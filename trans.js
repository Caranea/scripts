      "description": "William-Adolphe Bouguereau was the most celebrated French painter of his time. He was born in La Rochelle in November 1825 and brought up in a Catholic family in which none of his parents had a connection to the arts. At thirteen years of age, he was studying in a Catholic college in Pons, where Louis Sage – a former student of the Neo-classical artist, Ingres – taught him the fundamentals of drawing and painting. Not content with his religious studies, Bouguereau returned to life in Bordeaux with his family, where he enrolled in the Municipal School of Drawing and Painting in 1841, ultimately becoming a featured student. At this time, he also worked in a shop painting stone lithographs for lithographic prints. Five years later, Bouguereau moved to Paris with the plan to study art – a trip he funded by completing thirty-three oil portraits in only three months. In Paris, the painter began his studies at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts, where he not only studied drawing, but historical costumes, archeology, and anatomy by observing cadaver dissections as well – all to enhance his artistic techniques. His Academic influence came mostly from François-Édouard Picot, as he was admitted to his studio. As a Neo-classical artist, Bouguereau strived to revive the past master’s Classic approach to painting, primarily artists of the Renaissance, like Raphael. In 1850, at the age of twenty-six, the young artist submitted Zenobia Found by Shepherd on the Banks of the Araxes to the Prix de Rome and won a residence to the Villa Medici, where he would study for three years. During the height of his career, Bouguereau participated at the annual Paris Salon Exhibit and continued until his death. He would mostly portray mythological characters with extremely idealized, but realistic detail. From voluptuous nymphs to powerful Gods and Goddesses – Bouguereau gave life and soul to the painted subjects. As an opposition to the Classic themes, the French painter would also depict beautifully simple and humble women of the rural areas, as well as gypsies. By the 1860s, Bouguereau was associated with Académie Julian, a private school for painters and sculptors in Paris, where he lectured classes to hundreds of students. The artist, who was a widow, married his most successful pupil, Elizabeth Jane Gardner. Bouguereau was praised by the Academy throughout his career, receiving many awards, like the Grande Medal of Honour in 1885, and in 1905 was made the Grande Officier of the Legion of Honour, among others. Even so, many artists despised his work – mostly the avant-guard painters of the Impressionism. He would, later on, be dreaded amongst many other modern painters, like Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; making his popularity drastically decline and, consequently forcing galleries and museums to show less of his work. Ultimately, his artwork virtually lost its value in the market, but after the 1970s was rediscovered by art historians, reclaiming Bouguereau as the best painter of his time. William Adolphe Bouguereau passed away in August 1905, in La Rochelle, his hometown. ",

      "description": "Vincent Willem van Gogh, most commonly known as Vincent Van Gogh was born in the southern Netherlands, in a town called Zundert, in March of 1853. The Dutch painter became one of the most famous figures in art history – if not the most famous – creating over two thousand artworks during about a decade of production. Van Gogh concluded an enormous amount of paintings during the last two years of his life as he was afflicted, becoming known as the “tortured artist.” He grew up in a religious household, his father was a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, a path Van Gogh was passionate about and began to study after he worked as an art dealer with his uncle. In was only at twenty-seven years of age that Van Gogh began following an artistic career of his own, enrolling in the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1880, located in Brussels, Belgium. In 1885, the Dutch artist concluded his first masterpiece entitled The Potato Eaters, an oil painting portraying a family of peasants sitting at the table in a dark room. This artwork, along with many other of Van Gogh’s works, was influenced by the past Dutch masters of the Baroque movement like Peter Paul Rubens, with its dramatic shadows, as well as the Realists, who often painted workers of the rural areas. Throughout his entire artistic career, Van Gogh was unable to sell his paintings, even with the constant help of his brother, Theo, who was an art dealer. Theo was one of the main supporters of Van Gogh’s production, receiving his work by mail and attempting to sell them. In fact, most of the information known about the artist’s production came from the letters he wrote to his brother in exquisite detail about his artistic process, as well as details about his personal life, his goals, and ambitions. At the beginning of his production, Van Gogh had a dark and earthy color palette, and after receiving some insight from Theo, he began to brighten his paintings. During this period, the Impressionists were gaining a great deal of attention for their avant-guard style of work, which inspired Van Gogh to experiment with a more modern style of painting. In 1886, because of financial troubles, the artist moved to Paris to live with Theo and came in direct contact with the Impressionist painters. During this period, the Post-Impressionist’s work changed radically, experimenting with brighter color pallets and looser brush strokes. Two years later, Van Gogh moved to Arles, where he began an art studio called The Yellow House in hopes of working alongside Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh produced his series of sunflower paintings to show his friend his enthusiasm with the new studio, but after attempts of working together, the artists reached a crises point, and Van Gogh had an enormous breakdown mutilating his own ear. During the last phase of his career and life, the Van Gogh entered the Saint-Rémy asylum, where he produced his most famous artworks. The artist passed away in July of the next year at the age of 37.

      "description": "Pierre-Auguste Renoir was one of the leading artists of the Impressionist movement, alongside his colleague and friend Claude Oscar Monet. He was born in Haute-Vienne in the city of Limoges, France, in February of 1841. Three years later, his family moved to Paris, as his father was a modest tailor in search of a location with a better profit. As a young man, Renoir showed great talent for drawing and singing, and their new home was near the prestigious Louvre Museum. Unfortunately, he had to leave his studies behind because of his family’s financial issues and began to pursue a career in decorative porcelain painting. Renoir began his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and in 1871 he was mentored by Charles Gleyre. During this period that he met his fellow soon-to-be Impressionist colleagues; Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille – who died in the Franco-Prussian War at a young age. In 1864, Renoir began to exhibit his artwork at the traditional Paris Salon, but his work only became praised in the 1868 exhibit, with the oil painting entitled Portrait of Lise with Umbrella, concluded a year earlier. His work was not usually well received by the Salon, and most paintings were rejected. Tired of not being recognized by the Academy, Renoir and his colleagues joined to create their own art exhibit in April of 1874, which was harshly critiqued. Although the overall exhibition was not a success, Renoir’s work was favored to the rest of the artists. The term Impressionism was originally pejorative and came from Monet’s painting Impression Sunrise, which shocked the public and critics for its avant-guard style. The French artist was inspired by other modern painters that came before him, like Camille Pissarro and Edouard Manet, who opened paths for the new generation of artists. In 1881, Renoir traveled to see works of masters like Eugene Delacroix and Diego Velazquez. During that same year, the painter concluded the masterpiece Luncheon of the Boating Party, in which Aline Charigot posed as a model – a woman he would marry nine years later. They already had a child together before the marriage, Pierre Renoir, who became an actor – afterward, Pierre had a son named Claude who worked with filmmaking. Renoir’s other children were also artists – like Claude, who worked with ceramics and the filmmaker named Jean. The last phase of the painter’s career was the most challenging, as he developed rheumatoid arthritis around 1892 – a painful condition that forced him to move to a warmer location. In 1907, the Impressionist moved near the Mediterranean coast, in the French Riviera town called Cagnes-sur-Mer. His condition developed to a stage where he required assistance to grasp his paintbrushes. Renoir’s friend Richard Guino, who worked with clay sculptures, wished to help him by transferring his ideas into loose three-dimensional works and assisted him in this new medium. In 1919, the Impressionist had the honor of seeing his artworks in the Louvre, and he passed away by the end of the same year. ",

      "description": "Claude Oscar Monet is considered one of the most captivating French painters of the beginning of modern art and born on November 14 in 1840 in a financially stable family in Paris, France. Monet’s family moved to Le Havre, because his father, Adolphe Monet, and uncle began a business selling ship supplies. The French artist began his career very young, delving into the world of fun portraits becoming a caricaturist. In 1858, Monet had the experience of meeting who would become a significant influence on his career as a painter, Eugène Boudin, a landscape artist. Boudin taught Monet about painting outdoors – what they would later refer to as painting en plein air. Other artists would eventually work outside to sketch out plants and landscapes, but it was the Impressionists who made this technique famous, as they would complete a landscape painting on location – many times at one sitting. After studying for many months in Boudin’s studio, Monet continued his studies at the Académie Suisse but was forced to stop in 1860, for about two years because of military service in Algeria. Before leaving, Monet was already attending gatherings with where great artists of the Realism would attend, like Gustav Courbet. When the artist returned from Algeria in 1862, Monet met with Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean Frédéric Bazille, and Alfred Sisley in Charles Gleyre’s studio in Paris. This group of artists would eventually win the hearts of the public, as well as the audience with their modern painting. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Monet met with Paul Durand-Ruel, an influential art dealer in London, England. The next year, the artist and his newlywed spouse, Camille, moved to a commune in the suburbs of Paris, named Argenteuil, as he searched for beautiful natural surroundings, bathed in colorful sunlight. The couple stayed in Argenteuil for the next six years. During this period, the painter struggled with financial issues and would have dept collectors gather his belongings but was known to destroy his own artwork then have others take it. In 1874, the group organized there first art show in which included Monet’s painting Impression Sunrise, done in 1872. The art critics of the time fell hard on the avant-guard group and named them the Impressionists because of Monet’s daring landscape but in a pejorative way. These modern painters went against the standards of the Classic Academies, which ruled upon the art standards of the time, but eventually, their work would become loved by the public and critics as well. Monet and his colleagues of the Impressionism valued everyday scenes of nature, capturing the essence and experience of the surroundings with fast, expressive brushstrokes of bright and pure pigments. They strived to observe and capture the fleeting optical effects of sunlight over a landscape, instead of painting an idealized scene from inside a studio. Monet, the leading name in the Impressionist movement, gained financial and critical success by the late 1880s. The artist produced his most acclaimed paintings during the end of his life when living in Giverny, France, with his second wife, Alice. There he built a fantastical garden with a water lily pond, numerous amounts of vegetation, colorful flowers, towering trees, as well as a small bridge that went over the pond – inspired by the exotic work of the Japanese artists. Monet passed away in December 1926, in Giverny, after years of cataracts. ",

      "description": "Leonardo da Vinci was born in May 1519 in Vinci, the Republic of Florence – soon to be the center of Italian Renaissance. Coming from a simple family, the artist’s full name is Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, meaning he was the son of Piero, a gentleman, and from Vinci. Although little is known from his early life, he began creating and studying at a young age and went on to become successful in many areas, like painting and sculpting. Leonardo also delved into the world of invention, architecture, music, science, literature, engineering, astronomy, geology, botany, cartography, among others. Many historians consider the artist’s studies to be essential to the birth of paleontology, as well as ichnology – which involves biology and geology in the study of natural history. There is little information about his life as a child, but at the early age of fourteen, in 1466, he was already learning about art with his mentor Verrocchio in one of the best workshops in Florence. Leonardo studied artistic techniques, like painting and sculpting, as well as other highly technical skills – like working with leather, plaster casts, metallurgy, mechanics, carpentry, among many others – for about seven years. During this period, Leonardo collaborated by painting with other artists, as well as posing as a model for their work. Many other standout artists studied in Verrocchio’s shop, like Sandro Botticelli, Perugino, and more. During Leonardo’s youth in Florence, he was inspired by other artists like Masaccio, Ghiberti, and especially Piero Della Francesca’s detailed perspective studies – all contemporaries of Donatello. While studying the Renaissance in art history, three artists stand out and, although they were not from the same generation, they’re mostly named together – Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo. Leonardo was the oldest of the three, and Michelangelo continued working for about forty-five years after his death, delving into Mannerism. The multifaceted artist – who also studied anatomy – was fit to be a master in the Guild of Saint Luke at the age of twenty, an association of artists and doctors of the city, in 1472. Even though his father helped him achieve his studio, Leonardo continued to work with his past master, Verrocchio. In 1476, the artist and other young men who worked in his shop were accused of having relations with other men, which were strictly prohibited by law in Florence of this period. Because of this, virtually nothing is known about his work and life from this period until 1478. It was while working in Milan that Leonardo concluded his most famous artworks, like the religious mural The Last Supper, housed in Santa Maria Delle Grazie, as well as the commission for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, entitled Virgin of the Rocks. He resided in Milan from 1482 until the beginning of the Second Italian War in 1499. By this time, the artist was using his knowledge of engineering and architecture to defend the city from the invasion of French troops. Leonardo passed away at 67, possibly due to a stroke, in May 1519. Until this day, Leonardo da Vinci is considered one of the most genius human beings to have walked upon this earth, not to mention a brilliant artist of the humanist Renaissance era.   ",

      "description": "The Academic painter Jean-Léon Gérôme is one of the most important French artists of his time. He was born in May 1824, Eastern France, in a region called Vesoul, Haute-Saone. At the age of sixteen, he moved to Paris where he studied under the Academic master, Paul Delaroche, who was Neoclassical and delved into the Romanticist themes. Both master and apprentice traveled together to Italy in 1843 and was able to explore locations like the Vatican, Rome, and Pompeii. Although these cities were rich in culture for an artist to dive into, Gérôme was more interested in observing the world of nature around him. A year later, the artist was forced to return to Paris because of a fever. He would then study painting for a brief period in Charles Gleyre’s studio, like many other artists who previously studied under Delaroche, before attending the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts. The year 1846 was a turning point for Gérôme, as he failed to win the Prix de Rome because the judges thought his figure drawing was faulty. During the same year, the artist painted one of his first masterpieces, entitled The Cock Fight. Théophile Gautier, a significant French critic, praised the Neo-Grec oil painting – a style that revitalized the Neoclassical style during the reign of Napoleon III. The immense success of The Cock Fight changed the direction of Gérôme’s career, and he gave up on the Prix de Rome, focusing on grand commissions coming in from new patrons. As the years went by and Gérôme’s artistic production grew, so did the importance of his commissions. In 1852, the Academic painter received a grand commission to paint his prestigious historic piece entitled Age of Augustus, ordered by Alfred Emilien Comte de Nieuwerkerke for the Emperor’s court. This oil on canvas pays homage to Augustus, the first Roman Emperor while combining this theme with the birth of Christ, and the payment he received for it sponsored his trip to Constantinople the next year. Gérôme took several other inspiring trips to the East, exploring places like Turkey, the Danube, and Greece. In 1856, the artist took an important trip to Egypt, the first of many, where he was inspired by the Arab religion, the clothing, artifacts, and mostly the North African landscapes. Like many other artists of the time, Gérôme was taken by the Orientalist style and would create quick oil sketches on location. The next year, he entered his Orientalist works in the Paris Salon, like Camels at a Watering Trough, Duel after the Masked Ball, Egyptian Recruits Crossing the Desert, and Memnon and Sesostris – enhancing his reputation as an artist. After getting married to Marie Goupil, the daughter of a prominent art dealer, Gérôme built a studio in 1860 in their large home, with space for painting and sculpting. The artist was honored with many prestigious titles, like knighted in the Légion d’honneur, and was elected an honorary member of the Institut de France, as well as being part of the faculty of the École des Beaux-Arts, among others. Gérôme passed away at 79 years of age in his Paris studio in January of 1904. He was found facing a Rembrandt portrait and was near his masterpiece entitled Truth Coming out of her Well – a painting that speaks of illusion and its transparency, an influence of the rise of photography and its impact on fine art.

Brought up in a Catholic household with four more siblings - Godward being the eldest - his parents presented tyrannical behavior, which affected him throughout his lifetime. Godward’s began working in his father’s insurance company, a profitable career path, but instead decided to study architecture with William Hoff Wontner, whose son became a painter and a good friend of Godward. Like the master Frederic Leighton, Godward was an artist of the Victorian Neo-Classism - meaning he painted idealized subjects of ancient Greece. Also, aesthetically, Godward’s paintings resemble the masterpieces of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Both artists enjoyed portraying realistic textures of marble in the surroundings of Classical architecture. Alma-Tadena and Godward painted an artwork with the same title, In The Tepidarium, featuring a theme seen in most of Godward’s production; seductive and powerful women in an environment of ancient Greece. The British artist was keen on details and was able to portray intricate details with oil on canvas, giving life to fabrics, marble, and skin texture. As a part of the Neo-Classicism, a highly Academic movement, Godward’s art was based on historical research, striving for as much accuracy as possible. The artist painted detailed architectural backgrounds and clothing to assure the authenticity of the scene. He was praised by the Royal Academy, which he had his debut in the exhibition in 1887 and would continue to show his work until 1905. Godward also became a member of the prestigious Royal Society of British Artists in 1889, and his popularity grew. The British painter also became vastly known after Thomas McLean, an art dealer, made print versions of some of his work, meaning his art became more accessible to the public in general. In 1899, Godward had his first painting accepted in the Paris Salon. By the turn of the century, to Godward’s favor, the art world saw a revival of Classical interests. In 1913, he participated in the International Exhibition in Rome with the oil painting The Belvedere and won the gold medal for his masterpiece. It is common for viewers to mistaken Godward as a Pre-Raphaelite because of his primary subject beautiful and idealized Victorian women painted in vibrant color palettes, but the Neo-classicists focused more on ancient civilizations and not on Arthurian themes. In 1912, Godward moved to Italy and by this time he was not in contact with his family anymore. At the age of 61, the artist committed suicide, a year after returning to England. Godward was buried in west London, in the Brompton Cemetery in 1922. His family who never approved of his life choices destroyed his pictures and his suicide note. ",

      "description": "Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn, most commonly known as Rembrandt, was one of the most captivating Baroque artists of the Dutch Golden Age of the eighteenth century. Born in the Netherlands in July 1606. The artist set his mark on the movement with innovative use of light and shadow. He became most known for his self-portraits – even casually inserting himself in many biblical artworks. Rembrandt was a master at painting as well as etching, a printing technique of metal engraving. At this time, the Academic views on printmaking were not as high as oil painting and etching was seen as a secondary art without much value, but Rembrandt used it to his advantage. The painter captured the essence of his Baroque style into his etchings, making his art accessible all the world in smaller prints – much more accessible to transport and faster to produce copies than oil painting. As a young man, Rembrandt was dedicated to Latin school as well as having biblical studies. At fourteen years old, he was registered at the University of Leiden but decided to leave to deepen his knowledge of art and painting. In 1620, he began by learning his basic artistic skills with his mentor Jackob Isaaksz Swanenburgh – an artist known for his dark, hellish scenes of the underworld. Later on in Rembrandt’s career, he would show his influence on Swanenburgh’s approach to representing fire reflecting light. Rembrandt also studied under Pieter Lastman, a historical painter from Amsterdam who worked mainly with themes of the Bible, creating narratives in beautifully complex atmospheres. At around 1625, the artist opened a studio in Leiden with Jan Lievens, where he would produce his work and take pupils as well. Rembrandt’s work at this time reflected the influence of his former master, Lastman, and would often deconstruct his paintings, regroup and reassemble into a new artwork – a technique he taught his students. During this period, the artist focused on rich details on small canvases telling stories, mostly biblical. Rembrandt concluded his first etching in 1626, which would impulse him into international fame as he applied to this technique the same level of excellence he achieved in his oil paintings. At the end of the 1620s, he was committed to his innovative use of dramatic lighting – creating figures emerging from the shadows. In 1631, Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam after he bonded with an entrepreneur who was interested in his work. During the next five years living in the Dutch country, the painter produced mostly large-scale scenes of Greek mythology or Biblical subjects, as well as commissioned portraits – all with his dramatic use of light and dark. The Night Watch is one of Rembrandt’s most memorable work – a commissioned painting of immense proportions completed in 1642. This piece is a beautiful example of how the artist was able to transform a simple military portrait commission into an allegoric masterpiece filled with details. The period following this work was marked by a downfall in Rembrandt’s career and production, although the reasons are not clear to this day. ",

      "description": "John Singer Sargent was born in Florence – the capital of the Italian region of Tuscany – in January of 1857, and his sister Mary was born a year later. Although his birthplace was Europe, his parents, Fitzwilliam and Mary, were American and decided to leave the country to recover from the traumatizing death of their young daughter. The Sargent family initially intended to return to their home country, but their love for traveling made them nomads for the rest of their life – something that impacted the artist profoundly. Both Sargent and his younger sister were homeschooled, but the soon-to-be artist did not adapt to formal schooling, but despite this, he was brilliant, becoming fluent in German, French, and Italian at a young age. Sargent also featured an astonishing understanding of music, literature, and mostly art. His mother had a connection to art and believed that museums were as important as school. Eventually, Sargent’s father took him from Florence to Paris to study art, and his outstanding work was quickly noticed by the professors at the École des Beaux-Arts. Mentored by Carolus Duran, the American painter promptly found the balance between following the Academic guidelines to Classic painting and finding his unique, bold style. In 1879 – five years after entering Duran’s studio – Sargent was awarded in the Paris Salon for the portrayal of his teacher in the painting Carolus-Duran. This recognition marked his artistic career at only twenty-three years of age and led him to become the leading portrait painters of his time. By the 1880s, Sargent was taking portrait commissions from wealthy, influential patrons and was always featured in prestigious art exhibits. There was a particular socialite in which the artist was enchanted by and had a great desire to portray, called Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau. In 1884, Sargent painted his beloved model in Madame X and proudly showed the artwork in the Paris Salon of the same year, causing great controversy and scandal. The public was so outraged by the risqué sensuality that Sargent almost quit painting altogether. Because of the Academic rejection, as well as the public’s, the American artist decided to travel to Giverny and met with Claude Monet in 1885. The avant-guard style of the Impressionists inspired Sargent to deconstruct his formal techniques and work in a more loosely manner. Monet would take him to paint en plein air, to experience working in nature, and observe a landscape with its natural, fleeting lighting. Sargent began working with watercolor painting, experimenting with different techniques. By 1907, at the age of fifty-one, he became tired of the demanding traditional portrait paintings – especially of his bourgeois patrons – and decided to stop taking this kind of commissions altogether, focusing on traveling and painting his surroundings in intense watercolors. From the American Rocky Mountains to gondolas of Venice, all the way to the sunny beaches of Florida, Sargent continued his mother’s passion for traveling, producing breathtaking artworks of his experiences. He passed away in April of 1925 because of heart disease. ",

      "description": "Gustav Klimt was born in July of 1862 in Baumgarten, Austria, to a family of immigrants, along with six brothers and sisters. Because of their delicate financial situation, Klimt’s parents were always in search of affordable living situations, forcing them to travel a lot. Their position only got worse after the Vienna stock market crashed when he was only 11 years old. A year later, his young sister passed away, impacting him, but mainly his older sister and mother, Anna Klimt – who was very artistic as well. In 1876, Klimt began attending the Vienna School of Applied Arts and Crafts, at only fourteen years old, where he studied architectural drawing with a scholarship. His younger brother also joined the school, and both wished to become drawing teachers. They teamed up later on to complete many commissions of murals in museums, theaters, and churches. Klimt’s work began to change, opposing many of the Classical symbolism used by academic artists, and he sought inspiration in the decorative style of the Byzantine era. Along with painters, architects, and sculptors like Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, and Koloman Moser, Klimt formed the Union of Austrian Artists, more known as the Vienna Secession, and was the first president of the group in 1897. The modern group also created a magazine called Ver Sacrum. During this period, the Kunstlerhaus was the center of art venue but favored more conservative work over the avant-guard art, forcing modern artists to find an alternative way of promoting their work. After about eight years, Klimt and many other artists of the Secession left the group as they still struggled to maintain their sales and were often disagreeing with local galleries and their association with them. The Austrian artist was quite reclusive and spent about eight to nine hours working in his studio, denying the entrance of guests. Because of this, little is known about his way of working, although we do know he often hummed the tune “Der Lindenbaum,” by Schubert. On his studio door, there was a note stating that knocking would be useless since he would not open. Some critics say that the way Klimt was included in pop culture can make his work seem one-dimensional. Also, some academics state that it was a mistake to intellectualize Klimt’s art because of his simplicity as a person. He never lived on his own, dividing his home with his family. Art historians of the past constructed the notion of him being a “great artist-hero,” but contemporary historians believe that there is an effortlessness to his artwork, as it reflects the artist himself. At the age of thirty, Klimt was financially stable. He experienced the tragic loss of his father, Ernst, as well as his younger brother, leaving him responsible for his family. After many years of withdrawal from the art world, Klimt came back with a stronger desire to go against the artistic establishment by creating his own unique art. The painter’s work became even more symbolic, but not using the conventional iconography. His use of nudity caused much controversy, but he still received a significant amount of commissions from his patrons. Klimt was now working in the highly decorative style of the Art Nouveau, with bursts of color and large areas covered in gold. Klimt mostly painted portraits of sensual women but also became famous for his intense landscapes. Many upcoming artists were sponsored by him, like Egon Schiele. Gustav Klimt passed away on February 6, 1918, after the Spanish flu caused pneumonia and as well as suffering from a stroke. ",

      "description": "Joseph Mallord William Turner – or simply J.M.W. Turner – was born in April 1775 in London, England, although his actual birthdate is not certain. He had a younger sister named Mary Ann who sadly passed away at the age of five. His father, William Turner, was a wig maker and a barber. Because of his mother’s mental health issues, the young Turner was sent to live with relatives in Western London. In due course, Turner became the most famous and successful British artists of all time with his breathtaking Romanticist landscapes and working with materials like watercolor, oil painting, and printmaking. At only fourteen years of age, in 1788, he became a draftsman under the teachings of an architect, influencing his artwork throughout his entire career, as he included architectural constructions in many of his landscape paintings. One year later, Turner entered the Royal Academy of Arts in Somerset House, where they embraced a Classical approach to art. The president of the Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds defended the hierarchy of the themes approached by artists in their paintings. He considered artworks that worked with biblical subjects, mythology, historical events and literature subject were the noblest. After that came the genre paintings, meaning matters of the everyday life, which most often brought a virtuous sentiment. Lastly, in the lowest category, came still life, portraiture, and landscapes. It became Turner’s mission to emerge landscape painting to the category of historical painting by using the same amount of expressive power and complexity. Working with watercolors was an excellent match for his travels, as he would go about Europe in search of different landscapes, a ritual he began in 1791. Turner took up oil painting by the mid-1790s and was inspired by marine seascapes by Dutch painters of the XVII century. The British artist was also influenced by two French painters: Nicolas Poussin, and Claude Lorrain – who included historical and mythological subjects in his grandiose landscapes, something Turner embraced in his work as well. Turner’s most important subject became the “sublime,” which in his understanding meant the overpowering presence of nature and the insignificance of humankind regarding it. The artist would travel to places with untamed natural surroundings in the heart of Switzerland, and portrayed the immensely impactful views along with biblical themes, like the plague of Egypt. In 1819, after a tumultuous time in British history, Turner finally reached his dream location that he only knew from Lorrain’s paintings, Italy. In Child Harold’s Pilgrimage, the British painter depicts his idealized view of the Italian landscape based on a Romanticist poem – as a way to connect with the intellectuals of the time. J.M.W. Turner was described as a short-tempered and awkward man. He had a strong accent, since he came from the working class, and would often confuse his students, who had a hard time understanding what he said. He died in December 1851, in Chelsea, London, as one of the wealthiest and most famous British painters, leaving his fortune to friends, family, and charity. Many paintings were given to the Nation, and he was buried next to Sir Joshua Reynolds, by his request. Turner once stated that his only secret to success was his hard work. ",

      "description": "John William Waterhouse is arguably one of the most celebrated Pre-Raphaelite artists, although he was from the second generation of the movement. He was born in Rome in April 1849, about a year after the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood began in London. Both of Waterhouse’s parents were British painters, who eventually brought him back to their homeland and enrolled their son in the Royal Academy of Art. The painter began his artistic career following the standards of the Academy, focusing on large-scale works, subjects of Greek mythology, and grabbed the attention of public and critics in the Academy’s annual summer exhibit. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood began during a revolutionary period in Europe. Karl Marx had released his Communist Manifesto, and change was imminent in many countries. A group of young British painters wished to cause a revolution in the art world as well – Sir John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, and Dante Gabriel Rosette were the pioneers to the Brotherhood that would soon gather more painters and inspire artists for generations to come—tired of the predictability of Academic art, considering it boring and somewhat lazy. The Brotherhood had a great interest in poetry and literature, just as in visual arts, bringing new subject matters, like Arthurian legends and interpretations of Shakespeare’s work. Their earlier works portrayed mostly beautiful women with long, dark flowing hair – realistic but a bit idealistic, like seen in The Magic Circle, a painting from 1886. Later, the artists began to separate their artwork even more from the Classic standards by representing their subjects in extraordinarily life-like and realistic paintings. About a decade prior to the modern Impressionists, the Pre-Raphaelites were already turning their attention to matters of the urban life, while also working outdoors in many occasions – a technique the Impressionists adopted and called painting en plein air. As the name of the movement states, the artists were prone to art that was made before Raphael’s followers, which in their interpretation, created a particular formula in their work in which they followed. Waterhouse brought the Pre-Raphaelite movement into the twentieth century, although his earlier works portrayed Classical themes influenced by the Academy. He began showing his artworks at the Society of British Artists, as well as the Dudley Gallery. His first big success was concluded in 1874, entitled Sleep and his Half-brother Death, and was shown in the Royal Academy summer exhibit. After this, Waterhouse participated in virtually every art show until 1916, a year before his death, with a couple of exceptions. The British painter was inspired in poetry by Alfred Tennyson, which resulted in three different paintings of The Lady of Shalott. His oil paintings often portrayed beautiful nymphs of ancient Greek mythology, as well as women of Arthurian legends. Waterhouse became very ill due to cancer in 1915, which affected his productivity, and he passed away in February of 1917. ",

      "description": "Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, or as the world knows him as just Michelangelo is one of the successful and influential artists of all time, and undoubtedly had a significant impact on the development of Western art and culture. He was born in March 1475 in the village of Caprese, in Tuscany, Italy - named Arezzo, in the Republic of Florence at the time. Michelangelo had four brothers, and his mother became terminally ill when he was a small infant, his parents had no choice but to leave him with a wet nurse. The young Renaissance man ended up living with a family of stonecutters, which later on he speaks of how this influenced him to become a sculptor. At the age of six, in 1481, Michelangelo’s mother passed away. From a very young age, he had no interest in school. Michelangelo was even sent to Florence to study under Francesco da Urbino, a Humanist, but would find a way of skipping class to observe and analyze paintings in churches, seeking the company of other painters. During this period, he saw frescos of the Early Renaissance and Late Medieval periods, like works by Giotto and Masaccio. In 1488, Michelangelo was working as Ghirlandaio’s apprentice, and after a year, the artist’s father pressed Ghirlandaio to pay a salary, which he agreed to - a rare situation since Michelangelo was only 14 years old. During the same year, at the request of the current ruler of Florence, Ghirlandaio sent his best students to work for Lorenzo de Medici. The artist considered himself before anything else, a sculptor, although he was an astonishing painter, architect, and poet as well. Before he was able to make a name of himself, Michelangelo’s family was not supportive of his career choice, and after he became hugely successful, the artist would finish the letters to his family with “Sculptor in Rome” after signing. The artist was not always in a good place in his career, as he was not always under the wing of the Medici family, not to mention when Savonarola took over Medici’s spot as an authority in Florence in 1494, forcing Michelangelo to move temporarily. At the age of twenty-one, the artist moved to the grandiose Rome, where he would complete his greatest masterpieces; like Pieta commissioned in 1497. Pope Julius II had a massive task for Michelangelo, as he commissioned for him to build his tomb which was composed of forty statues as well as the architectural aspect. During the same period, the Renaissance artist took in a second commission from the Pope - one he was not too enthusiastic about - the Sistine Chapel. Along with a team of artists, Michelangelo painted more than 500 square meters of ceiling in a great height, done in fresco - a challenging painting technique in which he did not entirely domain. Although there were many setbacks, the masterpiece was done in four years, from 1508 to 1512. Adam and Eve, The Creation of Adam, The Deluge, and The Cumaean Sibyl, are just a few examples of the breathtaking artworks seen in the Chapel. Michelangelo was indeed a perfect archetype of the Renaissance man, even though he didn’t delve too much into other areas like his rival Leonardo da Vinci. One of the main marks of the Renaissance period was the construction of St. Peter’s Basilica, in Rome, especially the monumental dome, never seen before and designed by Michelangelo. Many artists followed in his footsteps, but as they copied and modified proportions, color palettes, and lighting, the Renaissance period had a decline so Mannerism could rise. ",

      "description": "The Spanish artist Goya was born on March 1746, with the full name Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, in the town of Fuendetodos, Aragón. His parents, Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador and José Bendito de Goya y Franque, had recently moved there from the capital city, Zaragoza. Goya had two older sisters, an older brother, as well as two younger brothers as well. Around 1749, their family would return to Zaragoza where they bought a house. In 1760, Goya, who was only fourteen, began studying painting under José Luzán and continued with his teacher for the next four years. After that, he decided to take what he learned and apply that on his own. The painter moved to Madrid and applied twice to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes of San Fernando, but didn’t qualify, in 1763 and 1766. During this period, he was studying with an artist of the Spanish royalty, Anton Raphael Mengs, but was confrontational against him. Because of his frustration with the academy in Madrid, Goya decided to move to the cultural capital of Europe; Rome. Many historians have speculated about his life during this period, but since he was still an unknown artist, not much is certain. In 1771, the Spanish painter was prized in a painting competition in Parma, the same year he completed two of his early mythological paintings: The Sacrifice of Pan and Sacrifice to Vesta. Goya got married to Josefa Bayeu y Subias on July 1773 - sister of his painting professor at the time, Francisco Bayeu y Subías. The couple had their first child about a year after getting married and named him Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos. The bond Goya had with his brother in law helped his artistic career since Bayeu became a member of the San Fernando Real Academia de Bellas Artes in 1765 and years later became director of the tapestry works. Goya was commissioned to conclude a series of illustrations to transfer onto the Royal Tapestry from 1777 to the next five years. During this period, he created more than forty designs in the Rococo style, and although this kind of work wasn’t very valued, it increased his popularity. The artist was also receiving commissions to produce copies of artworks from past masters in metal etchings - including prints from artists like Velazquez and Marcantonio Raimondi. Through etching - a craft he beautifully mastered - Goya was also able to spread his name as an artist. Throughout the 1780s, the painter began receiving commissions from members of the Royal circle, like the portrait of The Count of Floridablanca in 1783. In 1786, he was given an official position as Charles III’s painter, and three years later he became the court painter. Goya completed the controversial portrait of the Royal family entitled Charles IV and His Family, giving the Queen the spotlight. Another artwork that was not only controversial but scandalous was Maja Desnuda, not simply because of her nudity, but because of the lack of mythological or allegorical theme behind the painting. By early 1790s, Goya became ill and eventually completely deaf, which caused him to isolate himself and think he was going mad. The painter ended up having a complete breakdown, both mental and physical, a few weeks after the War of France on Spain was declared. Although many historians speculate on a series of diseases that the artist may have had, some find it possible he was suffering from lead poisoning - commonly found in paint and other painting and etching materials of the time. The beginning of the Peninsular War was marked by the French invasion on Spanish grounds in 1808. By 1812, Goya had lost his beloved wife and painted two of his masterpieces in the same year: The Second of May and The Third of May. By the end of his career, he lived alone in his studio outside of Madrid. Goya completed his final series of fourteen Black Paintings, including Saturn Devouring His Sons, during a tense phase of mental distress at the age of seventy-five. All of the paintings were done directly onto the walls of his house and are his most dramatic works. Considered one of the greatest Spanish artists of all time, Goya passed away in April 1828 at the age of 82, while in Bordeaux, France. ",

      "description": "Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, or more commonly known as just Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, was born on November 1864 in a commune named Albi, more specifically in the department named after the Tarn River in France. He was the first child of Adèle Zoe Tapié de Celeyran and Alphonse Charles Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, an aristocratic family in which he would have inherited the title fo Comte, but only if he had outlived his father. Lautrec’s grandmothers were siblings, meaning his parents were cousins, resulting in congenital problems and was possibly the reason his brother, who was born in 1867, passed away only a year later. Eventually, his parents split up, and the young Lautrec went under the care of a nanny. Lautrec was sent to live with his mother in Paris at eight years old, and she quickly noticed his innate talent for art. He was mostly interested in painting and drawing horses and would often draw caricatures in his schoolbooks. Rene Princeteau, a painter and a friend of his father, would periodically visit the young boy to give him lessons. A young artist who would become not only a beloved modern painter, but also a draughtsman, printmaker, caricaturist, illustrator, and who even wrote a cookbook, entitled The Art of Cuisine. Although today Lautrec is seen as a beloved artist of the Parisian cabarets, this didn’t come without struggles. He moved back to Albi in 1875 due to his health issues, as he had problems with his growth and development. Lautrec’s face had some deformities as he grew, causing him pain in his teeth as well. Because of his fragile bone, Lautrec fractured his femurs twice in two years, when he was thirteen and fourteen years old. After these incidents, his body never developed properly, leaving his legs shortened for the rest of his life, while his body grew normally - forcing him to use a cane. Some historians believe he had pycnodysostosis, which later became known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome. Princeteau was astounded with his pupils’ progress and convinced Lautrec’s parents to let the young artist study art under Léon Bonnat, a portrait painter, in Paris. Lautrec was mostly interested in the bohemian area of Paris, Montmartre - a hot spot for modern painters, philosophers, and writers. In 1882, Lautrec began to study with Fernand Cormon, who influenced his students to search for their artistic motifs in the streets of Paris. He met great modern masters like Vincent Van Gogh and Emile Bernard during this period which influenced his production. The artists’ exposure to the bohemian lifestyle, which included bars and brothels (reoccurring themes in his artworks) as well the traumas he endured because of his health and his appearance, led him to alcoholism. Although printmaking was looked down upon by many other artists, Lautrec created a beautiful series of lithographic posters for the Moulin Rouge, which helped tremendously in his income. He was inspired by early Impressionists like Manet and Degas, as well as the traditional Japanese woodblock prints. In 1886, Lautrec painted the masterpiece La Blanchisseuse - an artwork that sold for US$22.4 million in a 2005 auction. For many years the artist participated in the Société des Artistes Indépendants, continued selling artworks, and even exhibited works with Van Gogh. While on a trip to London, Lautrec became good friends and supporter of Oscar Wilde. Lautrec passed away in 1901 after his alcoholism and syphilis began to deteriorate his mental and physical health significantly. ",

      "description": "Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez was baptized in Seville, Andalucia, in Southern Spain on June 1599 and became the most important Baroque painter of the Spanish Golden Age, as well as being the main court artist, working for King Philip IV. As a child, Velazquez had a strict Christian education, where the figure of God was feared. He was a brilliant pupil and studied philosophy and languages. His love for art naturally showed at an early age, and he became Francisco de Herrera’s student for a year. The artist was only twelve when he left Herrera’s studio and started to work as Francisco Pacheco’s apprentice where he continued for five years. Pacheco worked with a more direct sense of realism, which contrasted with the Classical teachings - derivative of Raphael - and taught the young Velazquez a lot about perspective and proportion. Velazquez created a reputation as a great artist in Seville by the early 1620s and was quite aware of the artistic circles and trends of his city. The artist had two children with Juana Pacheco - his teacher’s daughter, which he married on April 1618. Their first-born was Francisca de Silva Velazquez y Pacheco, who married Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo, also a painter. Sadly, their second daughter, Ignacia de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco passed away as a small child. By 1622, the artist traveled to Madrid, where he met with the chaplain to King Philip IV. By the end of the same year, Rodrigo de Villandrando, one of the King’s best court painters, passed away leaving a spot for Velazquez to fill. By August of 1623, Velazquez was asked to complete a quick portrait of Philip IV, which was highly praised and, because of it, the artist was commanded to move to Madrid and became an official court painter. Not only that, Velazquez became the King’s exclusive portrait artist, and portraits done previously by other artists were stored. During this period, the artist traveled to Italy, a significant trip for him and his work. In 1629, he returned to live there for almost two years. As Philip’s head painter, Velazquez would join him on his various trips, like to Aragon in 1642 and again two years later. Altogether, the Spanish painter concluded forty portraits of the King, as well as portraying his family. It was an honor to sit for Velazquez, and some soldiers, churchmen, and Cavaliers had the opportunity. Philip had a great love for art and wished to found an art academy in Spain with Velazquez’s help, so he sent the artist to Italy to purchase sculptures and statues for the school. In 1651, the painter returned with hundreds of statues and pictures, but because of the strict rules of the Spanish church, many were destroyed after Philip’s death. The 1640s represent Velazquez best period, in which he creates his most authentic artworks. He concluded many portraits of the royal family and other notable members of the Spanish court, and by 1656, he culminated his efforts into his most celebrated masterpiece: Las Meninas. This period was marked by the violence of the Spanish Inquisition and its censorship among artists, but luckily, Velazquez was protected by his royal position. A Venus at Her Mirror is the only of Velazquez’s female nudes that still exists because of the censorship. After returning to Madrid in 1660, the 61-year-old artist began running a horrible fever, which led to his death in less than a week. Velazquez’s artwork was truly impactful for the Spanish Golden Era and continued to inspire artists of the XIX century, like Edouard Manet, and artists of the Impressionism, until the present day. ",

      "description": "Edouard Manet is considered by art critics and historians as one of the most significant painters of the transitional period from Classic to Modern art. He was born to an upscale Parisian family on January 1832. His father was a judge, Auguste, and his mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier was related to Swedish royalty, and her father was a diplomat. Manet’s uncle, Edmond Fournier, was the only relative who stimulated his love for art, taking him to visit the Louvre - unlike his father, who wished that Manet studied law. At the age of thirteen, the young aspiring artist met the politician and journalist Antonin Proust as he enroled in drawing lessons. Proust later became the Minister of Fine Arts, as well as Manet’s good friend. In 1850, the French painter began to study under Thomas Couture, an Academic artist, after he failed the admission test for the Navy. He continued studying with Couture for six years, in addition to copying works of past masters in the Louvre. During this period of studies, Manet also traveled extensively to locations like Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, coming in contact with artwork by Diego Velázquez, Francisco de Goya, and Frans Hals, all who inspired him deeply. After concluding his travels and studies with Couture in 1856, he opened his own studio. By this time, Manet was adopting themes of Realist artists like Gustave Courbet, emphasizing contemporary themes instead of Classical subjects of religious or mythological stories - The Absinthe Drinker, concluded in 1859, is an example of a painting with a Modern motif. In 1861, Manet received recognition from the Academy when two of his paintings were accepted at the prestigious Paris Salon, including the masterpiece The Spanish Singer. Although academically trained, Manet used looser brushstrokes and simplified details, which surprised many young artists. One of the artists first masterpiece was Luncheon on the Grass, which was rejected from the Paris Salon. The artwork was considered controversial and was shown in the parallel exhibit Salon des Refusés, organized by the Impressionists. Manet joined traditional compositions and references of Classic art in paintings with contemporary themes which shocked critics and public alike. The nude Olympia, painted in 1863 was another controversial masterpiece which references the Classic artwork Venus of Urbino (1538) by Titian as well as The Nude Maja by Goya. Olympia, a portrayal of a claimed prostitute, was eventually accepted into the Paris Salon, but not without creating a scandal. The same year Manet concluded the artwork, he married Suzanne Leenhoff, who appears in many paintings, including Reading. Berthe Morisot is responsible for bringing Manet to join in the Modern ways of painting around 1868, like painting en plein air, which she learned through Camille Corot. Through her, he met and befriended many painters of the Impressionism, like Camille Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, and Alfred Sisley. The artist’s body began to feel the health effects of his contracted syphilis by his mid-forties, especially extreme pain. His legs became partially paralyzed, and he developed difficulties in controlling his movements, known as locomotor ataxia. Manet was able to paint small artworks, mostly still lifes, like The Lemon and A Bunch of Asparagus, during the final phase of his life. In 1882, he saw his last masterpiece accepted in the Paris Salon; A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère). He passed away in 1883 in his hometown, about two weeks after amputating his gangrened foot. Manet was an outstanding artist, who not only produced beautiful Classic Realists paintings, but also delved into the modern world of Impressionism, and continues to inspire until today. ",

      "description": "The Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens - most commonly known as just Rubens - was born in the Holy Roman Empire in June 1577, in the city of Siegen. His parents, Jan Rubens and Maria Pypelincks, named their son as an homage to the Saints Peter and Paul. As a Calvinist, Rubens’ father fled to Cologne from Antwerp in 1568 with his family because of the commotion caused by the persecution of the Protestant faith. In 1587, at only ten years of age, Rubens lost his father, and two years later, he and his mother returned to Antwerp. It was then that the young man was brought up as a Catholic - a factor that would profoundly influence his life’s work. Rubens began to study art with Tobias Verhaecht at only fourteen years old, with a Renaissance and humanist education. He also studied classical literature and Latin. Later on, the young painter passed on the other influential teachers like Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort. Like many artists aspiring for greatness, Rubens copied artworks from others to study their techniques, like Marcantonio Raimondi and Hans Holbein, working with different mediums, like woodcut prints. Religious subjects were prominent in most of Rubens’ art, and he eventually became a leader in defending the Catholic Counter-Reformation, a movement in which the Catholic church began against the Protestant Reformation, with the intention to preserve their material wealth, power, and influence. In 1598, after completing his studies, Rubens entered the Guild of St. Luke, named after the patron saint of artists, Evangelist Luke. This city guild was designated for European artists, mostly located in the low countries, and Rubens was able to enter as an independent master. Two years later, the artist traveled to Venice, where he had access to paintings of great masters like Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. He finally settled in Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga’s court in Mantua, who supported him financially to travel to Florence and Rome during the next year, where he was able to study the work of great masters. Rubens was deeply inspired by artists of the High Renaissance like Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo, as well as the Baroque master Caravaggio. During his stay in Rome, the painter concluded his first altarpiece painting, entitled St. Helena with the True Cross at the Santa Croce Church. The Baroque painter didn’t only work with art, but diplomacy as well. In 1603, he took the first of many trips to Spain for his diplomatic endeavors. After returning to Italy a year later, he would remain in the country for four years, mostly painting commissioned portraits. Rubens was deeply influenced by his surroundings, as he insisted in writing most of his correspondence in Italian and signed as Pietro Paolo Rubens - an Italian version of his name. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 to visit his ill mother. Sadly, she died before he was able to arrive, and although the artist wished to return to Italy, he never did. A year later, Rubens was named as court painter by Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain and Albert VII, the Archduke of Austria. During this time, he got married to Isabella Brandt, and they moved into a new home, which was also his studio with many students and assistants - known today as the Rubenshuis Museum. Anthony van Dyck became one of his standout students. Rubens continued to produce monumental paintings with his team until the final years of his life. He received many awards and tributes during his lifetime for his excellence in fine art. The painter was named as a nobleman by Philip IV of Spain in 1624 and was awarded a Master of Arts degree in 1629 by the Cambridge Unversity, as well as being knighted in 1630 by Charles I of England. He passed away at 62 years of age, in Antwerp, and still received commission requests from patrons around the world during the final phase of his career. ",

      "description": "In October 1697, in the Venitian Republic, known today as Italy, Giovanni Antonio Canal was born. His mother was Artemisia Barbieri, and his father was Bernardo Canal, a painter of theatrical scenes. Since he followed in Bernardo’s footsteps, the Italian painter became known as Canaletto - meaning “little Canal.” He and his sibling learned the art of painting scenery with their father. Inspired by Giovanni Paolo Pannini, Canaletto went to Rome and began to portray what he saw in the cities everyday life. The first painting he signed is dated in the year of 1723 was titled Architectural Capriccio and beautifully defines his topographical style, but it is known that he began to work in this way since he returned home from Rome, in 1719. During this period, Canaletto was studying how to depict cityscapes with Luca Carlevarijs, known for his urban paintings. During Canaletto’s career, he portrayed views of London, Rome, and Venice, mixing reality with his own imaginary view and distortions of the scene. The artist’s approach to landscape and cityscape painting during the beginning of his career was quite different than most artists of the time since it was expected of painters to work inside their studio, while Canaletto preferred to work outdoors and in nature. The Stonemason’s Yard, although filled with details, is an example of the simplicity the artist used to portray a part of his city, resulting in a fine and beautiful piece of art. Along with oil painting, Canaletto was an excellent printmaker, working with metal etching. During this time, many British aristocrats were embarking on an adventure they called the grand tour, which consisted on visiting a number of locations in Europe to learn about art and culture. Canaletto’s studio became an important stop for many of these rich entrepreneurs on the grand tour, who would acquire paintings of the places they visited as a souvenir of their trip. By 1728, the artist had become close to Joseph Smith who eventually became his main patron. The British businessman who lived in Venice at the time helped Canaletto sell his artwork to influential and wealthy clients, like King George II who purchased an extensive collection of paintings, drawings, and etchings in 1762. In 1746, the Italian artist moved to London, which he stayed for about ten years, portraying the many sights he came across. After the War of the Austrian Succession bursts, the number of visitors in Venice lowers dramatically, leaving Canaletto no choice but to move closer to his clients. The artist continued completing commissions of castles and houses for his clients, but after many years his work became a bit repetitive and mechanical. By the end of his career, Canaletto moved back to his hometown, where he spent his final days painting. In 1763, he was elected into the prestigious Academy of Venice. He would often use his old sketches to complete finished paintings, but would also make brand new artworks with daring compositions and altered topography. Canaletto died on April 19th, 1768. ",

      "description": "Tiziano Vecellio was the most significant artist of the Venetian school, working alongside other distinct painters like Tintoretto, Giorgione, Caliari, among others. Better known as Titian in English, the information about his birth is unclear, but historians speculate it was around the years 1488 and 1490 in Pieve di Cadore, in what was the Republic of Venice at the time. There isn't much information about his parents as well, Gregorio Vecelli and Lucia - more of Gregorio, who was an acclaimed soldier and councilor, as well as working for the Castle of Pieve di Cadore as superintendent. As a young boy, by the age of eleven, Titian was sent to live in Venice with his uncle and brother Francesco. Both boys began studying painting under the best artists of the city; firstly Gentile Bellini. They soon changed and began to study with Giovanni Bellini, Gentile’s brother. The Italian painter differed from the artists of his time, and alongside Giorgio da Castelfranco, better known as Giorgione, the painters worked in a more flexible manner, not giving the same importance to symmetry as other painters of the time. The two painters became the leading names of the arte moderna, a new way of painting. In 1511, Titian painted a series of frescos in the Carmelite Church and the Scuola del Santo, at Padua - one of the most challenging techniques to achieve in painting. Among these paintings is Miracle of the New-Born Infant, The Miracle of the Jealous Husband, The Healing of the Wrathful Son, among others. The artist returned to Padua in 1512 and began an art studio on the Grand Canal. In a period of six years, the artist lost two of his friends; Giorgione passed away in 1510 and Giovanni Bellini in 1516. This marked the beginning of Titian’s mature period, that lasted through around 1530, his influence of Giorgione was left aside, and he ventured into larger, monumental style paintings and subjects of high complexity. With the loss of his colleagues, Titian remained as the most celebrated artist of the Venetian school for many years - reaching the peak of his career around 1521. Titian completed many paintings of mythological subjects, like Danae and the Shower of Gold, a commission for Alessandro Farnese that he made other versions, including for King Philip II - a patron who Titian completed many other mythological paintings for as well. The Italian painter developed into a more dramatic style in 1530, introduced with his masterpiece The Death of St. Peter Martyr. The artist worked on a series of Venus portrayals while visiting Rome, including Venus with Organist and Cupid, and Venus of Urbino. During the final phase of Titian’s life and career, beginning at around 1550, King Philip II was his main patron and he worked mainly producing portraits. His work became extremely precise, as the artist felt the need to perfect his craft to the fullest - to the point where he would work on pieces for about a decade, retouching and redefining details. Instead of portraying tragic subjects like in Christ Crowned with Thorns, or the divine poetry seen in Supper at Emmaus, Titian was more focused on perfecting color palette like skin tones, during his old age. Titian also delved into the chiaroscuro technique, developed by Leonardo da Vinci, which enabled him to work with the dramatics of the work - seen in his final masterpiece Pieta. In fact, Titian was one of the transcendent painters of the High Renaissance and influenced many artists of his time and of many generations to come. He passed away in August 1576, as Venice was taken by the Bubonic plague, which took the life of his son, Orazio Vecellio who was also a painter, shortly after. Although Titian’s date of birth is unknown, but historians speculate he died at least at the age of eighty. ",

      "description": "Not very much is known about the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer Van Delft, also known as Johannes Vermeer, even though his Baroque masterpieces are recognized worldwide. Born in a town called Delft during the Dutch Golden Age, a location known for its merchants and the various branches of canals. Vermeer’s birthdate is not certain, but he was baptized in October 1632. This period was turbulent and enriching at the same time, as there was a significant expansion in the art market because of the growing trade with the East Indies – on the other hand, there was an ongoing feud between the Protestants and the Catholic church. Vermeer was able to take this turbulent reality and put it on hold as he portrayed peaceful scenes of the everyday life in his art. Different from most Baroque painters of this period, Vermeer almost abolished the narrative from his work. His central theme involved calm interior scenes, mostly of middle-class women in leisure or realizing chores and portraying an idealized every-day life of the Dutch middle-class. Even though his work differed from other artists of the time, Vermeer gave great importance to the contrast between light and dark – one of the main characteristics of the Baroque period. The artist’s paintings are rich in detail, small in dimension, and he concluded very few during his lifetime, despite that he dedicated his life to art. Historians still don’t know where Vermeer went to school, or who taught him how to paint, but it is known that he used camera obscura as a support for his technique. This instrument was used by many painters of the time and allowed the artist to visualize and easily draw out the scene in which he is observing. This mechanism would later serve as a base for early photography. Vermeer and his family were an ordinary middle-class family but lived in the central part of Delft, a wealthy region. His father, Reijnier Janszoon, owned an Inn and began an art dealership on the side, which Vermeer eventually took over after his death in 1652. The next year, at the age of 21, the Baroque painter proposed to Catharina Bolenes, a Catholic girl whose mother persuaded Vermeer into converting to their faith. This was a complicated course of action because the rising of the Protestant church forced Catholics to hide their faith and join together in clandestine churches. The painting Allegory of the Faith (1670-1672) is a rare example of Vermeer’s work in which he uses symbolism, possibly concluded for a Catholic patron. Some of Vermeer’s most celebrated oil paintings include The Milkmaid (1658), The Lacemaker (1669-1670), and Girl With the Pearl Earring (1665), in which a romance novel was written based on the mysterious female figure, and eventually a movie as well. After a collapse in the art market, Vermeer got ill possibly due to stress because of his financial instability and passed away shortly after, in December 1675. ",

      "description": "The French Neo-Classical artist Jacques Louis-David was born on August 1748 to a wealthy family but had an unusual childhood. Around the age of nine, he lost his father after he was murdered in a duel, leaving his mother no choice but to leave her child with his two uncles. They were both architects and strived for the young David to have the best education - hoping that he followed in the same career, as did his mother. Although he studied at the prestigious Collège des Quartre-Nations, in the University of Paris, David was not a model student. He was more interested in drawing and already wished to become a painter. He eventually followed the path he dreamed for himself, going against his family, and began to study with the Rococo painter François Boucher, one of the most popular painters of the time. But Boucher found it a better choice for David to study under Joseph-Marie Vien at the Royal Academy since Vien was more in tune with the Classical renewal happening in art. During his time of studies, David entered the Prix de Rome - one of the most prestigious prizes of Academic art. He failed at his three first attempts, including The Combat of Mars and Minerva, resulting in a dreadful grudge against the Academy. The painter persisted and finally won the Prix de Rome in 1774. In October of the next year, David and his mentor Vien traveled to Italy, where they studied the artworks made by the masters of the XVII century, like Caravaggio and Poussin. Although David found the pieces stagnant, he completed more than ten sketchbooks with studies and drawings he gathered from his trip in which he would use as a reference for years to come. During this period he met Anton Raphael Mengs, one of the precursors of the Neo-Classical movements and a significant inspiration for David and his work. In 1779, David took an influential trip to Pompeii which strengthened his belief in the power of Classical culture. He also studied the masters of the High Renaissance deeply, like Raphael. Tired of the pompous and frivolous style of the Rococo, David became a militant of the French Revolution, along with one of the most influential figures of the Revolution, the lawyer and politician, Maximilien Robespierre. The artist continued in the country to fight for what he believed in - the execution of Louis XVI. After the King’s execution, David created one of his greatest works, The Death of Marat; considered the Pieta of the Revolution. Robespierre eventually fell from power and David was taken to jail. After he was released, David found one of the most powerful allies he could have: Napoleon, France’s First Consul. The artist concluded works like Distribution of the Eagle in honor of the Emperor, representing the self-sacrifice needed for their superior and the glory of the battlefield. After Napoleon’s fall from power, David moved to Brussels and later to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Jacques Louis-David gave lessons to a large number of students during his life and participated in the Paris Salon for many years, becoming one of the most influential artists of XIX century France. The Neo-Classical master concluded his last work in 1824 entitled Mars Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces. He passed away in December of 1825 at the age of 77 after being struck by a carriage while leaving the theater. ",

      "description": "The Parisian painter Alfred Sisley was born on October 1839 to British parents, William Sisley and Felicia Sell. The affluent couple worked in the silk business and as a music connoisseur, consecutively. They wished that Sisley followed in his father’s footsteps as a businessman, sending him to study in London at eighteen years old, in 1857. During this period he came in contact with the work of Romantic landscape painters John Constable and J. M. W. Turner, that influenced his later production. After four years, Sisley gave up and returned to his hometown to follow his goal to become an artist. Not many of his early studies still exist, but most consisted of landscapes with dark and earthy color pallets, many of which he painted at Saint-Cloud and the royal residence Chateau de Marly. Sisley’s later work was also inspired by the Realist artists Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. In 1862, Sisley began to study under the Swiss artist Charles Gleyre at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts. During this period, he met Claude Monet, Fréderic Bazille, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The group of artists had similar views on the art world, eventually breaking the Classic standards of painting landscapes inside studios, completing outdoor paintings they called painting en plein air. Not only did they have a different view on landscape painting, but they also brightened their color pallets with looser and thicker brushstrokes - the group would become known as the Impressionists after their first independent art show in 1874. Artists like Edouard Manet and Camille Pissarro brought Modern subjects and themes that influenced Sisley and his peers. Among the group, Sisley focused more on producing landscape, although he was often overshadowed by the other avant-guard painters. During the 1860s, Sisley received financial support from his father, which helped him pursue his artistic career without worrying with making a living through his production. He and many other of the Modern painters often had their works rejected by traditional art institutions like the Paris Salon. Sisley had a stable relationship with Marie Lescouezec by 1866, with whom he had a son and daughter together, Pierre and Jeanne. During this period, the couple lived near a hot spot for Modern painters at the Café Guerbois, at the Avenue de Clichy. Sisley continued sending works for the Paris Salon, and in 1868 some paintings were excepted. By 1870, Sisley saw himself without his father’s allowance after the Franco-Prussian War affected his business. The artist struggled to sell his paintings, resulting in a life of financial struggles. By 1880, Sisley and his family moved to a small village near the landscapes in which the artists of the Barbizon School portrayed in their art. In January 1899, Sisley passed away at the early age of 59 because of throat cancer. ",

      "description": "The Dutch artist Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema has initially been named Lourens Alma Tadema by his father Jiltes Tadema and his mother, Hinke Dirks Brouwer. He was born on January 1836 and was his mother’s third child, and his father’s sixth; as Tadema means “son of Tade”. Along with his family, the young Tadema moved to a city near Leeuwarden in 1838, because of his father’s work. Jiltes passed away shortly after, leaving Hinke with five children to tend to - including the three boys from his previous marriage. Inclined to work with art, Hinke understood its importance and encouraged her children to study drawing. Although Tadema had contact with the art world as a child, his family wished he’d study law, but in 1851 everything changed. The young fifteen-year-old fell ill - diagnosed with tuberculosis, and the doctors gave him a short time to live. This tragic news inspired him to do what he always wished before his death: make art. Tadema dedicated his time to painting and drawing while recuperating his health and proving his doctors wrong. In 1852, now in perfect health, Tadema moved to Belgium where he studied at the Royal Academy of Antwerp. He continued at the Academy for four years and was praised by teachers and critics for the works he produced there, even receiving many prestigious awards. He left school by 1855 and began working as an assistant to Louis Lodewijk Jan de Taeye, a teacher and painter who had lectured Tadema on art history and historical costumes during the Academy. The Dutch painter eventually became Taeye’s studio assistant and was inspired by subjects of the Salian Frankish dynasty, named Merovingian - depicting the scenes in great historical accuracy. Around 1858, Tadema left for Leeuwarden and then Antwerp to work in the most prestigious art studios in Belgium with Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys. After about four years, the artist feels prepared to start his career on his own and left Leys’ studio. In 1863, Tadema married to Marie-Pauline Gressin Dumoulin, who he has three children with - the eldest passed away an infant, while the two daughters, Anna and Laurence, became a painter and a writer, respectfully. Tadema began an interest in Classical subjects after visiting Florence, Naples, Rome, and Pompeii for his honeymoon, reflecting on his production for many years. In 1865, the artist had the honor of being knighted at the Order of Leopold in Brussels, where he had moved. Tragically, Pauline passed away after contracting smallpox in 1869, at the age of thirty-two, leaving the widowed artist in a deep depression, who stopped painting for months. By the end of 1869, Tadema was visiting the painter Ford Madox Brown in London, where he met a young girl named Laura Theresa Epps. He became madly in love with her, deciding to move to London in 1870, and they got married a year after. Epps was a highly respected painter herself and appear in Tadema’s paintings like The Women of Amphissa. Tadema hit the peak of his artistic career, becoming the most well paid and famous painter of his time. In 1871, the artist came in contact with Victorian artists of the Pre-Raphaelites, influencing his work, especially in his color pallet. On June 1912, at seventy-six years old, Tadema passed away after undergoing treatment for stomach ulcers, outliving his beloved partner by about three years. Tadema continued painting until his death, concluding his last major artwork in the year of his passing, entitled Preparation in the Coliseum. ",

      "description": "Caravaggio was originally named Michelangelo Merisi and born in Lombardy, Italy on September 1571. Because of the bubonic plague that devastated the area, his family fled to the town of Caravaggio, which would later become the artist’s commercial name. By the age of six, most of his family members were taken by the plague, and he eventually became an orphan at only eleven years old. It was then the painter Simone Peterzano took him in and to Milan where he continued as an apprentice for about four years. As a young man, Caravaggio was quite rebellious and was even part of a gang with swordsmen and other painters. Oftenly he was involved in street fights, and after fighting with a policeman, the painter was forced to flee to Rome During the late XVI to early XVII century, the Vatican had overwhelming power and was attracting artists from all over Europe in search of recognition. The streets are filled with clerics, mercenaries, beggars, pilgrims, among other male figures in search of a better living while many women saw no other alternative but to into prostitution. The city was extremely hostile, filled with arguments, fights, and disorder. Caravaggio arrived without food or money, living on the streets and fighting for survival. In 1606, one of the artists fights took a tragic end, and he murdered a man, forcing him yet again to run from the law. The height of Caravaggio’s career was when Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte takes him in as his prodigy. The Cardinal had purchased two of his paintings and was very pleased with the painter’s dramatic and smart artworks. Being under the wings of del Monte was a huge leap for Caravaggio, as this meant that his art was being recognized for its excellence. In fact, he was Galileo’s main patron as well. Although Caravaggio was one of the greatest painters of not only the Baroque period but of all art history, little was known about his life until about fifteen years ago. The artist’s life was filled with mystery and seen in a pejorative manner. Recent historians now understand a little more about his life and about why Caravaggio was always on the run and often in jail as well. His turbulent and dark life was definitely reflected in his work. Caravaggio beautifully used light to give a new view on oil painting. Although he worked for the religious institute, he was able to bring controversial figures into his work as he worked with traditional Christian themes to his contemporary world. Although this exact information was a mystery for decades, historians now know that Caravaggio was murdered in July of 1610. ",

      "description": "Vasily Vasilyevich Kandinsky, most commonly known as Wassily Kandinsky was one of the most well-known artists of the modern times. Originally born in Moscow, Russia in December of 1866, the painter and graphic artist traveled throughout Italy at a young age along with his family. Kandinsky was a prodigy child, mastering the cello and piano, as well as writing poems when he was only five years old. In 1886, Kandinsky began studying at The University of Moscow - not art, but law and economics, continuing in this area for the next seven years. In 1893, he eventually accepted to become part of the university’s law faculty. During this time, he was fascinated by the Russian folk art, as well as the decoration from rural village homes. In 1895, the Russian scholar had the opportunity of seeing an exhibit of the Impressionists in Moscow which caught his attention. Claude Monet was featured in the Impressionist exhibit with paintings of haystacks which fascinated Kandinsky, as they seemed not to have been properly finished. These modern paintings had such an impact on him that the next year - when he reached the age of thirty - he decided to pursue an artistic career. Inspired by the new approach to art, the Russian artist concluded his first abstract painting in 1910 using watercolor. But by 1914, the First World War had begun, and only three years later the Russian Revolution was in action, the same year Kandinsky and Nina Andreewsky got married. The artist was involved in social politics, helping organize more than twenty museums with the responsibility of becoming the director of the Museum of Pictorial Culture, after the overthrow of the czar. By 1921, Kandinsky was the founder and vice-president of the Academy of Arts and Sciences and was also working as a professor at the University of Moscow. Unfortunately, the Soviet’s views on modern art became very strict, and ultimately Kandinsky left the country. The Russian artist went through a period known as “architectural” period, beginning around the year 1920 and lasting approximately four years. In this mid-period, Kandinsky lived in Weimar, Germany, and became a professor at the prestigious Bauhaus – a school designated for exceptional students of design, architecture, and art. The artist’s view of painting was profoundly spiritual and emotional and saw the use of abstract forms as a way to transcend boundaries of physical and cultural representations in art. His work was done with the intention of helping society by sharing his ideas and often joined his art with music, as he saw it as a non-objective kind of art as well. In 1944, Kandinsky passed away while living in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. He will forever be remembered in art history for his innovations in painting and for becoming one of the first to delve into the world of abstract art. Until this day, his art touches the heart of many around the world, just as he wished that every stroke would correspond to the complex human soul. ",

      "description": "Martin Johnson Heade was born in Pennsylvania, in August 1819. He was from a small community in Bucks County, along the Delaware River, in a village called Lumberville, but was destined to larger American cities, as well as exotic tropical locations throughout his career. His family owned the village’s main commerce until the mid-1850s and was originally named Heed. By the age of twenty, Heade was studying painting under Edward Hicks, a folk artist, and most likely with Thomas Hicks as well, his cousin. He began portraying mostly portraits during the 1840s, a motif he eventually left behind. After spending a couple of years abroad in Rome, Heade began to exhibit his work in prestigious galleries, like the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and at the National Academy of Design in New York - a location he eventually settled at in 1859, about a decade after he began to exhibit his art frequently. During this period, Heade became friends with many artists of the Hudson River School who inspired him to landscape painting. He created professional bonds with painters like Sanford Gifford, Albert Bierstadt, and Frederic Edwin Church - who became his close friend as well. His interest in landscapes had already been incited before moving to the Big Apple. In 1857, he met Benjamin Champney and John Frederick Kensett, two outstanding painters from New Hampshire, more specifically the White Mountains. Church’s friendship was not only important to Heade at a personal level, but at an artistic level as well. Church’s 1859 painting entitled The Heart of the Andes had a significant impact on Heade, inspiring him to take the tropical motif farther. He traveled to the exotic rainforests of Brazil in 1863 and 1864, documenting the incredible nature in a series of sketches and studies. Heade was mesmerized by the Brazilian fauna and flora, like the colorful, delicate flowers, and tropical birds, especially the hummingbirds. The painter continued exploring tropical locations to romantically portray in his artworks, like Nicaragua in 1866, as well as Colombia, Jamaica, and Panama four years later. Heade was indeed inspired by the Romanticists of his time but represented a separating from these artists. The same goes for his relation to the Hudson River School, as he preferred to depict scenes with less grandeur, like the tidal marshes of the New England coastline. Ultimately, his salt marsh landscapes became his best-known works. By the end of Heade’s career, he was living in St. Augustin, Florida with his wife - where he moved to in 1883 and would continue living and producing his art until his death. During this period, he enjoyed painting still life compositions of delicate flowers on smooth velvet - a motif that the artist already had interest for a couple of decades. The importance of Heade’s works became known to scholars and the public during the 1940s, and it was found that he created an extensive body of work, passing any other American artist of the XIX century. Heade passed away in September of 1904. ",

      "description": "Mary Cassatt was an outstanding, influential artist and feminist of her time. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - at the time, known as Allegheny City which was later appended to Pittsburgh - in May 1844 to a family of the American upper middle class. Robert Simpson Cassat, her father (who added the extra “t” later on) was a stockbroker and would often invest in acquiring promising lands. Although during her lifetime, her father would always supply her with financial support, he wasn’t supportive of her decision to become an artist. Her mother, Katherine Kelso Johnston, on the other hand, would encourage Cassatt to travel and was passionate about literature and culture in general. Katherine had an enormous influence on the artist’s work through her entire career, as her central motif was the bond between mother and child. She lived with her six siblings, although two passed away when infants. Traveling was part of Cassatt’s education, so as a child she spent many years in Europe learning how to speak German and French, as well as beginning to study art and music. While abroad she went to various locations like Berlin, London, and Paris, where she had access to European’s most exceptional artworks. In 1855, at only eleven years old, Cassatt visited the Paris World’s Fair and saw oil paintings by the Neo-Classical artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, the Romanticist, Delacroix, and the Realists, Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. She also saw works by her future colleagues Camille Pissarro and Edgar Degas. Cassatt returned to the USA and began to study at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts at the young age of fifteen. Her family opposed her decision to become a professional artist, since this period it was not considered a suitable occupation for a woman. The painter was a feminist; an advocate for equal rights, and just becoming an artist was already an act of resistance. During the American Civil War, Cassatt studied in the Academy, from 1861 to 1865, but eventually grew tired of the chauvinistic education system that didn’t find it essential for women to learn about art. There weren’t many women painters in the Academy, and when there were, they would only be allowed access to plaster casts for referênce, meaning the men were the only ones allowed to work with live models. Like many other artists of the time, Cassatt decided to study painting by copying the works of past masters. Not seeing any future for her art in America, in 1866 she moved to Paris officially ending her formal studies, since women were not allowed to attend the École des Beaux-Arts. But she didn’t give up and continued studying with Jean-Léon Gérôme and later on with other artists as her teacher, as well as making daily visits to the Louvre. In 1868, the Paris Salon accepted artworks done by women for the first time - Elizabeth Jane Gardener and Cassatt, who exhibited A Mandoline Player. Although many avant-guard painters began to go against the Academy and defend modern art, Cassatt continued submitting her art to the Paris Salon. In 1877, Cassatt experienced a low point in her career, in which the Salon didn’t accept her work. By this time, Degas made the exciting offer for her to join the Impressionists and she agreed. After Berthe Morisot, Cassatt became the second woman to join the group. During this period, she expanded her artistic abilities by working with pastels and etching with the help of Degas. The American artist became quite debilitated by the turn of the century, and by 1911 she was still working after being diagnosed with cataracts, neuralgia, diabetes, and rheumatism - only stopping completely three years later, when she became almost entirely blind. Cassatt passed away on June 1926 near Paris, at Château de Beaufresne. ",

      "description": "The landscape artist Frederic Edwin Church came from a wealthy family from Hartford, Connecticut. In fact, he was a direct descendant of the British Puritan pioneer Richard Church, who took an exploratory journey through unknown territory of the US, along with Thomas Hooker. Also, his grandfather, Samuel Church, founded the first paper mill in the US, in Massachusetts. Son of Eliza and Joseph Church, Frederic was born in May 1826, and because of his financial stability, he was able to pursue his passion for painting at an early age. At only 18 years old, Church knew what his aesthetics were and went after the best landscape painter of the time to mentor him as his teacher, Thomas Cole. After some years of dedication, Church became the youngest artist to be an Associate of the National Academy of Design. Church was learning about art in the Catskills, NY, the birthplace of the Hudson River School, a group founded by Cole. This movement began in the mid-XIX century and was deeply influenced by Romanticism, meaning they often idealized their portrayal of landscapes, emphasizing the grandiose beauty of nature. The artists of this movement would gather not only in the countryside of the Catskills, but also the Adirondack Mountains, the White Mountains, and the Hudson River Valley. Cole passed away prematurely in 1848, opening the movement to the second generation of artists, which consisted of his best students - including Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford, and John Frederick Kensett. The three leading artists of the second generation gave considerable attention to the light of the landscapes they portrayed - what is known as Luminism. Along with other painters, they founded the world famous Metropolitan Museum of Art located in New York City. Only during the beginning of Church’s artistic career did his work resemble his teachers’, and after some time he focused more on the realistic style while creating multiple light sources. The artist, just like Cole, was a Protestant, which reflected on early works as well. Church and his peers wished to portray the untouched and unsettled pastoral landscapes of North America, which were quickly being occupied by civilization. By 1850, Church was officially settled in New York City and followed his method of going out to nature to make sketches of the beautiful landscapes in pencil, pastel, and oil painting, while retrieving to his studio to paint the final artworks indoors. In 1853 and 1857, the American artist took two very influential trips to the exotic city of Quito, in Ecuador. There he produced many drawings of the foreign landscapes which inspired him greatly to later conclude artworks like The Andes of Ecuador, The Heart of the Andes, and Cayambe. Most of his paintings were not only produced for the sake of art, but for science as well - as he depicted every plant and animal as a precise scientific study, although idealistic. By the time the American Civil War broke out, Church had concluded the painting that was also produced as a lithographic print to sell on behalf of the families of the soldiers, entitles Our Banner in the Sky. Church passed away at 73 years of age, in April 1900. ",

He was mainly recognized for his exquisite seascapes, executed with masterful rendering ranging from the clouds to the reflection on the water. Eugene Louis Boudin was born in July 1824, in Honfleur, France, his father was a harbor pilot. At age 10, he already worked on a steamboat that sailed between Honfleur and Le Havre, where he then moved with his family in 1835. His father opened a picture frame store, leaving the seafaring life, and thus his son gave it up as well since he had no vocation for it. Later on, Boudin would open his shop, where pictures were framed. In this period, he came to meet many artists working in the region, as well as having exhibited paintings by Jean-Francois Millet and Constant Troyon. He was also encouraged to pursue an artistic career by Thomas Couture and Jean-Baptiste Isabey. By his 22 years, he would abandon the commerce career and devoted himself only to painting. He traveled to Flanders and Paris, and in 1850 earned a scholarship that allowed him to move to the later. He would still return to the Normandy region regularly to paint, as well as to Brittany. Eugene Boudin was heavily influenced by the Dutch masters from the 17th century. He came to meet the Dutch painter Johan Jongkind, who suggested Boudin paint outdoors. The artist made many notable acquaintances, like Gustave Courbet, who him to poet and critic Charles Baudelaire. He was the first critic to raise Boudin`s artworks to public attention in his Paris Salon debut in 1859. By that time, Boudin was already friends with young Claude Monet, who was still around 18 years old, and Boudin`s influences in his work can be noticed, especially on how they represented water reflections. In 1873, Boudin would join Monet and his young painter friends in the first Impressionist exhibition, however, Boudin never considered himself an innovator like his colleagues. Because of the artist’s growing reputation, he was able to travel extensively during the 1870s — he visite southern France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and later, several trips to Venice. Towards his late life, the artist continued to participate in exhibitions. In 1881, he received a third-place medal at the Paris Salon and a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1889. In 1892, Boudin became a knight of the Legion of Honor, the highest civil and military order of merit of the French government. Eugene Boudin died in 1898, in the city of Deauville, Normandy, France.

He was the third son of a reverend, among his siblings are notable women like Elizabeth Johnson and the acclaimed writer, Mary Palmer, who wrote Devonshire Dialogue. Mary was seven years older than Joshua and was very fond of drawing, which certainly had an influence on him as a boy. She even helped finance Joshua’s pupilage, under Thomas Hudson, as well as his trip to Italy along with expenses, nine years later. As a boy, influenced by Zachariah Mudge, Reynolds became very interested in Platonistic Philosophy, which became an essential reference to him throughout his life. Among his influences, evidenced by his commonplace book, are William Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Richard Steele, André Félibien and Leonardo da Vinci, but a heavy influence was An Essay on Theory of Painting, by Jonathan Richardson. At age 17, he became Thomas Hudson’s apprentice, in London, for a period of four years. Hudson’s major influences was a collection of drawings by Old Masters, which Reynolds had to copy and study. Reynolds left Hudson in the summer of 1743, moving to Plymouth Dock, now the city of Davenport, working as a portrait painter for a brief time, returning to London by the end of 1744. Reynolds was invited to join the HMS Centurion ship, under the command of Commodore Augustus Keppel. After visiting Algiers, Cadiz, and Lisbon, he left the ship in Minorca and from there to Livorno and then Rome, where he stayed for two years, studying the Old Masters. Leaving Rome, Reynolds began making his way back to London, passing through Venice, Bologna, Florence, and Paris. He had Giuseppe Marchi as his assistant, who accompanied him for most of this journey, and would be his assistant till the end of his life. Upon his arrival back to England in 1752, he established himself in London. Reynolds was very prolific and achieved recognition rapidly. As a result of his fame as a portrait painter, Joshua Reynolds often enjoyed the circles of the wealthy and distinguished men and women of the time. Reynolds was highly intellectual and nurtured many friendships among the erudite English elite. Reynolds was one of the founders of The Club or Literary Club, along with Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, the distinguished statesman and philosopher. Reynolds became a highly distinguished and essential member of the English art society. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as one of the founders of the Society of Artists of Great Britain. In 1768, Reynolds became the first Royal Academy of Arts President, the next years he was knighted by King George III, becoming the second artist to receive such an honor. Reynolds retired from painting after losing the sight of his left eye. He became severely ill on New Years Day of 1792. Sir Joshua Reynolds passed away in his house on 23 February 1792. ",

      "description": "Giotto di Bondone, mostly known only by Giotto, was an Italian architect and painter from Florence. He was active during the Late Middle Ages, producing artworks of Late Gothic and Proto-Renaissantist style. Giotto di Bondone is mostly known only by Giotto. He was born circa 1267, although the precise date and place are mostly unclear, recent research suggests Giotto was born in a region north of Florence and was the son of a peasant. His proficiency in art was noticed at a young age. The early Renaissance sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti published in his book about Tuscan artists that, as a boy, young Giotto was a shepherd. At one time, the young artist drew a picture of a sheep on a rock slab; Cimabue, who was the foremost painter of the period, saw such drawing and promptly took Giotto as his pupil. Whatever are the origins of their professional relationship, scholars believe that Giotto came under Cimabue’s tutoring by his ten years of age. Giotto probably accompanied his teacher to Rome, before arriving in Assissi, where Cimabue received a commission to decorate the lower Basilica of St. Francis. Giotto married in 1290, to Ricevuta di Lapo del Pela. Around the same time, Cimabue left Assissi to attend to other commissions, while Giotto was commissioned to finish the higher level of the aforementioned Basilica. Soon, Giotto surpassed his teacher Cimabue in both technical prowess and overall fame, being recognized by distinguished contemporaries, such as Dante Alighieri, who even referenced Giotto and Cimabue in his Divine Comedy. During the early 1290s, Giotto received his first significant commission in Assisi, between 1290 and 1295. In said artwork, Giotto displayed a significant pictorial development in his composition. Following an extensive period in Assisi, the artist began to travel regularly to Italian city-states, a practice that somewhat characterized his career as a whole. The artist established several studios on many different locations, where his assistants would emulate Giotto’s style. His workshops also produced artists that developed a career of their own. By the turn of the century, Giotto spent three years in the city of Padua, where he received a commission decorated the Scrovegni Chapel or Arena Chapel, which would arguably become his most famous artwork. Giotto’s artwork on the Peruzzi Chapel became very well-known and celebrated by distinguished Renaissance painters, such as Michelangelo. By 1328, Giotto was summoned by the King of Naples Robert of Anjou to his court, probably as a recommendation by the Bardi family, as Giotto recently executed frescoes on the family’s chapel in the Santa Croce church. Giotto di Bondone died on January 8, 1337. ",

Mucha presented his talents for art at an early age and was lucky enough to have free access to paper - which was expensive and hard to find - after a local merchant saw his work and decided to help him. By the age of eleven, he began to sing at the choir of the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral and continued in the art form his entire life. During this time, Mucha was very religious, and his country was taken by a radical Czech nationalism, which affected all artistic areas. Although he was passionate about singing, Mucha knew his true fate was to be a visual artist. In 1878, the young artist faced his first deception in his career, as the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague denied his application, stating that Mucha should find another career path. At the age of nineteen, Mucha moved to Vienna, where he worked as an apprentice for a theater company, painting the scenery. This period was significant, as he dove into cultural activities, like visiting museums, churches, as well as receiving free tickets for theaters from his work. Mucha came in contact with the artwork of Hans Makart, whose academic art inspired him greatly - especially his massive historical paintings. By this period, the artist began to experiment with photography - an essential element for his future work. After a tragic fire that destroyed one of the main theaters that the company worked for, Mucha was left without a job. In 1881, he found himself forced to migrate, so the moved to southern Moravia in Mikulov where he worked for Count Belasi, a nobleman, in large commissions, as well as painting portraits, lettering for tombstones and decorative art in general. Count Belasi enabled Mucha to take expeditions to Milan, Venice, and Florence, where he came in contact with many artists. Although there is no record of the painter being enrolled at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, it is known that Mucha’s patron brought him to Munich so he could complete his formal training, a location he moved to in 1885. Because of the rigid restrictions of the Bavarian authorities, Mucha wasn’t able to remain any longer in Munich as an international student, resulting in a move to Paris in 1887 with the Count’s support. In Paris, the artist studied at the prestigious Academie Julian and Academie Colarossi, while he decided to follow in Ludek Marold’s footsteps and work with illustrations for magazines. He would later produce works for books as well. In the summer of 1893, Mucha shared a studio for a while with the Modern painter Paul Gauguin. It was by 1895 that the painter would begin to receive a considerable amount of recognition for his work. He came in contact with Sarah Bernhardt, a French actress, and produced posters for her shows - some of his most famous work, like La Dame aux Camelias, Gismonda, Medée, Lorenzaccio, La Samaritaine, and Hamlet. Mucha became famous worldwide as an artist of the Art Nouveau, but he didn’t enjoy this very much, as he strived to become a successful historical painter. Along with creating breathtaking egg tempera paintings and vivid posters in lithographic prints, the artist also designed costumes, jewelry, sets, and many times photographed his models as reference. In 1900, he finally had the chance to create his large-scale historical paintings for the Paris Universal Exposition. By the first decade of the 1900s, Mucha traveled to New York, where he was very famous, and back to Paris many times. He continued to produce his paintings during the First World War, although materials were scarce. By the 1930s, the Nazi troops threatened Czechoslovakia, and on March of 1939, they reached Prague. Mucha was captured by the Nazis, where he was interrogated for being a Slav nationalist. After a few days, the artist was let go, but died in July of the same year at the age of 78, after contracting pneumonia. ",

      "description": "Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi was originally from Florence, Italy, born around the year 1445 and is most commonly known as Sandro Botticelli. During this period, his hometown was overflowing with artists and intellectuals. Florence was building a reputation of celebrating the work of writers, philosophers, and visual artists, resulting in a large number of people immigrating from other parts of Europe. After a period of what some historians call dark times, peace and tranquility began to uprise. The Early Renaissance marked the start of one of the most famous and beloved Eras of the art world. As a young boy in school, Botticelli was already gifted in the art of drawing and enjoyed to play practical jokes on his friends. Determined to become an artist, he dropped out of school at fourteen to dedicate himself to studying art. At about 1461, Botticelli’s skill led him to learn under one of the most important painters of the time, Fra Filippo Lippi, who worked for the most wealthy family of Florence and the main patron of the arts, the Medicis. Through Lippi, the young apprentice learned many drawing and painting skills and techniques, including the art of fresco painting, considered the most difficult painting technique to accomplish, which consists of painting with pigments on wet plaster. Botticelli began his own art studio and workshop at only fifteen. It was through Lippi that Botticelli met the Head of the Medici Family, Cosimo de Medici, who became his main patron. The artist thrived under his patronage, creating breathtaking religious paintings and some artwork portraying mythological themes as well. It is known that Botticelli was against marriage and never tied the knot in his lifetime. In spite of that, art historians have speculated about a possible love interest: Simonetta Vespucci, a noblewoman known for her beauty and who tragically died at the young age of 22. Botticelli painted a couple of portraits of Vespucci, including Portrait of a Young Woman, but throughout the artist’s career, she seems to appear as other characters in his work. Vespucci was Botticelli’s muse and can be seen as Flora in The Birth of Venus (some say even Venus herself), or as one of the Three Graces in La Primavera, both artworks located in Uffizi. Along with Venus and Mars and Pallas and the Centaur, La Primavera and The Birth of Venus are the most iconic works of the Early Renaissance and have been studied and analyzed countless times by art historians. The Renaissance era thrived by renewing classical ancient Greek mythology. Botticelli’s prime came by his thirties, and in 1481 he was commissioned to conclude one of his most prestigious works; Pope Sixtus IV summoned him to paint frescos in the newly built Sistine Chapel - about thirty years before Michelangelo painted the ceiling. There the artist painted beautiful religious works like Scene from the Life of Moses and The Temptation of Christ. By Botticelli’s mid-life, Florence wasn’t as peaceful as before, as it was taken by plagues as well as invasions. Because of the tumultuous situation, the Medici family were eventually expelled, leaving Botticelli without his patrons. Girolamo Savonarola, an intensely moralistic preacher, came to power and had a significant influence on Botticelli’s paintings, as he followed Savonarola’s ideals. By the end of his career, the Renaissance painter saw his work become less popular, until the point where he became virtually unknown. During the last year of his production, Botticelli was depicting expressive and distorted figures and experimenting with non-natural colors, which some historians link to early Mannerism. Botticelli passed away on May 1510 in Florence, and the importance of his art was rediscovered only by the late XIX century. ",

      "description": "John Frederick Herring Senior was a highly successful British artist of the Victorian Era. Born in September 1865 in London, Herring had Dutch blood in his family, and his father was a merchant born in America. As a child, Herring was passionate about horses and drawing - passions that continued throughout his life. He continued living in London until he turned eighteen, when he moved to northern England, in Doncaster. There he was able to witness exciting horseraces, like when the Duke of Hamilton’s “William” won the race of St. Leger Stakes. A year later, in 1815, the young nineteen-year-old artist married Herring married Ann Harris. The couple had five children together: their three boys became artists like their father - John Frederick, Charles, and Benjamin - while Ann and Emma, their two daughters, married painters. While living in Doncaster, Herring’s love for horses lead him to work as a coachman, and he would also paint signs for local inns. He eventually was commissioned to paint artworks of horses for these inns and was granted with the nickname: the artist coachman. His work caught the eyes of wealthy patrons who commissioned works with themes of hunting and racehorses. In 1833, Herring moved back to London, but only after spending three years in Newmarket, England. William Taylor Copeland, a member of the parliament and a wealthy businessman, became the artist’s patron in a time of financial difficulties, commissioning designs for his family china business, Copeland Spode. In 1836, as his son John Frederck Herring Jr. was making a career as an artist, Herring added the Senior to his name to differentiate. Herring had the honor to work on behalf of the son of Louis-Phillipe, King of France, the Duke of Orleans, creating many paintings. He also visited Paris in 1840 after the Duke’s invitation. The artist’s production had caught the eye of Europe’s monarchy, raising his popularity, especially as an animal painter. In 1845, Herring received the honor of having the ruling Queen Victoria as his patron, and she continued commissioning work from him for the rest of his career. During the same year, his work was also requested by the Dutchess of Kent to produce animal paintings. By the end Herring’s career, he eventually stopped producing paintings of horses and moved to southeast England, in a rural area of Kent in 1853. The artist changed to narrative themes and agricultural landscapes, as well as his usual paintings of hunting and outdoor subjects. Herring was a gentleman and a landowner, known in England as a country squire, and was an extremely successful artist throughout his career. Art historians consider him as one of the most important animal painters of the XIX century, just as Sir Edwin Landseer as well. Herring's artworks were extremely popular, and many were created into engravings, making his work more accessible to the public through prints. The British artist exhibited his work for almost fifty years at the prestigious Royal Academy, as well as 35 years at the British Institution. In 1842, Herring became vice president of the Society of British Artists, where he participated in art exhibits for more than fifteen years. Herring passed away on September 1865, eleven days after completing 70 years of age. ",

      "description": "Sir Thomas Lawrence was an English painter, most known for his portrait paintings of distinguished figures. He became the fourth president of the renowned Royal Academy of Arts. Thomas Lawrence was born in April 1769, in the city of Bristol. His parents had sixteen children, but only five of them survived beyond infancy, Thomas Lawrence was the youngest. Although having a poor formal education, between his eight to six years old, Lawrence was a prodigy child, showing precocious talent towards drawing and reciting poetry. He was also proficient in billiards, boxing, and fencing. With only ten years old, he already achieved relative notoriety, being mentioned by Daines Barrington in one of his texts. After his father`s bankruptcy, Thomas left with his family to the city of Bath, where young Lawrence settled as a portraitist in pastels to support his family. Among his subjects were prominent figures like Sarah Siddons, Warren Hastings, Sir Elijah Impey, and the Duchess of Devonshire. Lawrence was popular, and the people of Bath were very fond of him, wealthy people even allowed him to their artwork collection. By 18 years old, Lawrence and his family moved to London, promptly making acquaintances with distinguished English artist Joshua Reynolds, who advised young Lawrence to study nature instead of the Old Masters. Soon, Lawrence became a Royal Academy student and showed several works at their annual exhibition in 1787. He left the institution shortly after. He became focused mainly on his portraiture and abandoned the drawing of classical sculptures. From that year until his death, the artist participated in the Royal Academy annual exhibitions almost every edition, thus achieving considerable recognition. In 1792, the artist was elected as a Royal Academy Associate. Following Sir Joshua Reynolds’ death, Lawrence was appointed by King George IV as his Painter-in-Ordinary. In 1794, he became a full Royal Academician. Now the artist would begin to have his studio assistants and pupils. Despite his success, the artist endured constant financial problems due to mismanagement and a lifestyle that surpassed his income. Lawrence was also an avid collector, which contributed to his monetary struggles. In 1814, Lawrence received a significant commission to paint allied generals and head of state for what became the Windsor Castle’s Waterloo Chamber. The artist was knighted in the following year. Following a brief period in Rome, where he painted Pope Pius VII, the artist returned to England in 1820. Soon, Lawrence was elected as the Royal Academy’s president, following Benjamin West’s death. Sir Thomas Lawrence died on January 20, 1830, in London. ",

He was baptized under the name of Hovhannes Aivazian and received education at the Feodosia's St. Sargis Church. His first artistic education was with a local architect. At age 16, Aivazovsky moved to the Russian Capital, St. Petersburg, and became a student at Maxim Vorobiev's landscape class at the Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1835, at age 18, he was appointed as assistant to the French painter Philippe Tanneur, on top of receiving a silver medal. Two years later, Aivazovsky joined Alexander Sauerweid on battle-painting and participated in exercises of the Russian Navy in the Gulf of Finland. Later that year, he graduated with a gold medal in the Imperial Academy of Arts. Aivazovsky was sent to study in Europe by the Imperial Academy of Arts. He first went to Venice and Vienna, where he visited San Lazzaro Degli Armeni, the location of an important Armenian Catholic congregation, where he studied and became familiar with Armenian manuscripts and art. He then headed to Amalfi, Sorrento, and Florence, where he met the Russian painter Alexander Ivanov. He remained in Rome and Naples between 1840 and 1842. Through this period, he was heavily influenced by Italian art, and he would study in their museums. He also traveled to Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Britain, where he made acquaintances with the painter J. M. W. Turner, who was very impressed by Aivazovsky's painting, The Bay Of Naples at Moonlit Night. Aivazovsky's works were admired throughout Europe. He also visited Portugal, Spain, and Malta. While in France, he was awarded a gold medal by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de sculpture. Returning to Russia, Aivazovsky was made an Academician at the Imperial Academy of Arts, as well as appointed as the official artist of the Russian Navy to paint naval battles, coastal scenes, and seascapes. In 1845 he returned to his hometown, Feodosia, he settled there, building a house and studio. After that, he isolated himself, and that didn't take a good turn to his artistic career. In that period, around the mid-nineteenth century, Russian art was changing from the Romanticism towards Realism, but Aivazovsky didn't go through this change. He continued painting Romantic seascapes, which he was heavily criticized. Aivazovsky worked in Paris from 1856 to 1857, where he received the French Legion of Honour, which is the highest order of merit to receive, civil or military, he was the first Russian and the first non-French as well, to receive it. He also received the Order of the Medjidie in Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire, the Greek Order of the Redeemer, and the Russian Order of St. Vladimir. He was also elected as an honorary member of the Moscow Art Society. ",

      "description": "William Blake was an English artist with multiple talents. He was a painter, writer, poet, and printmaker. During his lifetime, Blake was quite unrecognized. However, the artist would later become one of the most influential figures in the history of visual arts and poetry of the Romantic period. He also created prophetic artworks based on his religious visionary experiences. William Blake was born in November 1757, in the London's district of Soho. Although his parents were English Dissenters, Blake was baptized at St James's Church. That would be an early and robust influence throughout Blake's life. He attended school only until ten years old when he learned how to write and read, from this point on, his education was at home, under his mother's teachings. Young William Blake showed a keen interest in drawing, making engraving copies of Greek antiquities drawings, which his father bought for him. This is when he would make his first contact with classical styles through works of Michelangelo, Durer, and Raphael. At 10, his parents enrolled him in drawing classes instead of regular school. In 1772, when William Blake was 15, he became engraver James Basire's apprentice for seven years, which after this time, he would become a professional engraver. Blake entered the Royal Academy of Arts in 1779, where he stood for six years. Over time, Blake came to detest the institution's president, Joshua Reynolds, whose visions towards art like his beliefs in general beauty and truth Blake despised. On that matter, Blake would say: \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\". William Blake would meet and marry Catherine Boucher in 1782. She was illiterate, and her wedding contract was signed with an X. Blake taught Catherine writing, reading, and engraving. She would prove an invaluable partner throughout his life, helping him printing his artworks and maintaining his positiveness in cases of misfortune. One of the artist's most traumatizing experience occurred in 1787, caused by the death of his brother Robert, a victim of tuberculosis. Allegedly, Blake saw the spirit of his brother ascending through the ceiling. In 1804, Blake began writing and illustrating one of his most ambitious projects to date, the Jerusalem series, concluded in 1820. He also exhibited two paintings, Satan Calling Up His Legions, and Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims, which were met with a cold reception and an even harsher published review, referring to Blake as an \"unfortunate lunatic.\" Such a reaction devastated the artist, hindering his productivity and plunging him further into obscurity, poverty, and paranoia. However, in 1819, Blake would begin his series of visionary heads, depictions of imaginary and historical figures that, according to him, actually appeared and posed to him. Amongst these characters are Merlin, the magician, and King Solomon. Maybe the most famous of them is The Ghost of a Flea. By the end of his life, Blake executed 21 engravings for an illustrated Book of Job and Dante's Inferno. Willam Blake died in 1827, victimized by an undiagnosed disease. ",

      "description": "Not much is known about Pieter the Elder Bruegel’s background and family, creating many theories. Born approximately between the years 1525-1530 in Brabant, the State of the Holy Roman Empire, Bruegel became the most important name in Northern Renaissance. Early art historians contemplate on the possibility that the artist grew in a peasant background, because of the emphasis he gave on the theme in his work. Later on, with a better understanding of his artwork, other historians concluded that Bruegel must have been an educated townsman and that his portrayals of society were highly intellectual, based on his contact with the humanists. The young artist began to study under Pieter Coecke Van Aelst in 1545 and continued for five years until Van Aelst’s death. A year after, he was named a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the patron saint of artists, in Antwerp. During the same period, Bruegel was working on an altarpiece, which is now lost, as an assistant to Peeter Baltens. After this, the artist traveled to Italy, France and risked himself in Southern Reggio Calabria in 1552, a tumultuous region where he witnessed the devastation after a Turkish raid. In 1553, he returned to Rome and by 1555 moved to Antwerp. In 1863, Bruegel got married in Brussels to Mayken Coecke, who was the daughter of his painting teacher, Van Aelst. In Brussels, Bruegel had direct contact with the Humanist circles and the city was an essential governmental city in which he remained resident for the rest of his life. By this time, he dedicated himself fulltime to painting, and this became the pinnacle of his career. Bruegel’s artwork became extremely popular, especially amongst wealthy patrons, like Flemish art collectors, not to mention Titian’s patron, Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. Like seen in The Peasant Dance, Bruegel was able to reinvigorate ordinary and even marginalized themes, like medieval subjects, peasants and land workers represented in the fines of oil painting. The theme became so prevalent in his work that many knew him as “Peasant Bruegel.” Bruegel had three children, the two men became great artists - Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger - and there is virtually no information about his daughter. Although they followed in their father’s footsteps, Bruegel passed away before he had the opportunity to train them formally. The artist changed his original name by dropping the “H” making it sound more Latin, possibly as a consequence of his contact with Humanist philosophy. Bruegel passed away on September 1569, around his mid-forties or early fifties. Although he passed away at a young age, his contribution to the art world is priceless. ",

      "description": "Not much is documented about the early life of George Stubbs. He was born in Liverpool, in the northwest county of Lancashire, England in August 1724. Mary and John were his parents, and his father was a specialist in processing leather - a trade he taught Stubbs. The rare amount of information about Stubbs' life until his mid-thirties is based on Ozias Humphry’s informal notes, based on conversations he had with his friend. Around the early age of fifteen, Stubbs knew he wished to work as an artist, a decision that didn’t please his father. After some time, John agreed to help his son follow his own choice in career and encouraged him to find an exquisite teacher. In 1741, Stubbs’ father passed away but left his blessing so his son could follow his path in art. Enthusiastic about delving into the art world, Stubbs learned under Hamlet Winstanley for a brief period, an artist from Lancashire. Although he had access to study the masterpieces of the Knowsley Hall, he came in conflict with his mentor and decided to follow his path as a self-taught artist. His childhood fascination with anatomy leads him to study the subject more profoundly. He moved North in York in 1744, and a year later he began working as a portrait painter. With the help of Charles Atkinson, he was able to study human anatomy at the County Hospital. In 1754, Stubbs took a trip to Italy, where he saw the Classic Greek and Roman art. Years later, he stated that after this trip he was convinced that nature will always be superior to art. The artist was passionate about animal anatomy as well, especially horses. He spent about 18 months in a farmhouse he rented in the village of Horkstow dissecting and studying horses, in 1756. The illustrations produced during this period are now owned by the Royal Academy. During this time, he was assisted by his partner, Mary Spencer. Ten years later, while living in London, Stubbs published the fruits of his labor; The Anatomy of the Horse. Stubbs’s work was praised by influential aristocrats, who were his patrons even before he published his book. In fact, the 3rd Duke of Richmond was already his patron since 1759, and throughout the years he was fortunate to have his excellence in painting recognized by many other dukes, lords, and members of the nobility. With his success, he was able to purchase a home in Marylebone, London. Stubbs’ son, born in 1756, George Townley Stubbs, also became an artist, specializing in printmaking. One of Stubbs’ most famous artwork is entitled Whistlejacket and emphasizes the artist’s domain of animal anatomy, as he represented a racehorse in motion. This piece can be seen at the National Gallery in London. The British artist had a large task at hand during the end of his life, which he began in 1795. He was producing a series of engravings comparing the anatomy of various species, like the human body, the tiger, and the fowl. Unfortunately, Stubbs passed away on July 1806, before concluding the series. He passed at the age of 81 in London. ",

      "description": "The American painter Edwin Lord Weeks is known as a master of Orientalism. Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1849 to a family of wealthy merchants, who came from the suburbs of Boston - more specifically Newton. His parents worked in the profitable tea and spice market, which enabled the young Weeks to travel as much as he wanted, as well as study painting. He began to paint at around the age of eighteen, in 1867. His early travels include the Republic of Surinam, in South America, and the Florida Keys. By the early 1870s, Weeks’ real talent for painting began to bloom, as his skills of constructing beautiful compositions started to show, as well as his spectacular technique. A year later, the American artist moved to Paris in search of great masters to tutor him. He then became a pupil of the prestigious Academic artists Jean-Léon Gérôme and Léon Bonnat, quickly emerging as one of the top Orientalist painters of his time. Many Academic painters of this time delved into Orientalism, which strived to depict the aesthetics and cultural aspects of the Middle East. Historians and writers were also highly interested in the subject as well. Weeks was an avid traveler and portrayed his journies as the fundamental theme for his artworks. He began by exploring South America in 1869; a year later he traveled to Egypt and Persia. Between 1872 and 1878, Weeks went to Morocco, where he concluded paintings like The Camel Rider. In 1882, the American artist found more breathtaking motifs in India, where he stayed for approximately a year and painted Old Blue Tiled Mosque Outside of Delhi, India, The Barge of the Maharaja of Benares, Before a Mosque, among others. Weeks didn’t only register his travels in his paintings but also wrote and illustrated books of his adventures. In 1895, he published the book entitled From the Black Sea Through Persia and India, and Episodes of Mountaineering in 1897. He was deeply praised by the Academy, as he exhibited his artwork virtually every year in the Paris Salon, which granted him a Medal of Honor in 1884. He also received a Third Class Medal and a Gold Medal, both in 1889 at the International Exhibition. Weeks died in November 1903 in Paris, around the age of 54. ",

      "description": "Tintoretto was an Italian painter from Mannerism. He was one of the most notable Venetian school painting exponents and highly appreciated by his contemporaries. His fast and dynamic style of painting rendered him the nickname of Il Furioso or The Furious. Tintoretto was born as Jacopo Comin in 1518, in Venice, Italy. He was the oldest of 21 children. His father was a tintore, or dyer, giving origin to his nickname of Tintoretto, dyer's boy or little dyer. Jacopo was a born painter, and as his father noted his proficiency, he took his son to Titian's studio to see how far he could go as an artist. Tintoretto starts studying under Titian around 15 years old, and with only ten days in, the great master sent Tintoretto home for good. Titian observed some very unique style and spirited drawings. It's unclear the reason of his expelling, whether it was because Titian was jealous of such a young and promising talent or because Tintoretto exhibited his very own style and would not be pupil material. However, they would never have a close relationship, and Titian and his adherents would even give him the cold shoulder. Tintoretto sought no further teachings and became self-taught with much work and zeal. Much of Tintoretto's early works were commissions made with little or no payment, such as a The Ascent to Calvary and King Belshazzar’s Banquet. Almost all of these artworks are lost. Some of the surviving artworks are Christ and the Woman of Samaria, The Annunciation, The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple, Death of Abel, and Adam and Eve. His The Embarkation of St. Helena in the Holy Land was attributed to Andrea Schiavone up until 2012. There were two paintings concluded together as a pair: The Discovery of the Cross and St. Helen Testing the True Cross. Tintoretto received a commission for his last painting of considerable importance. Paradise was a painting of massive proportions and complex execution, at the time it was regarded as the world's largest canvas painting, size 74.1 by 29.9 feet. The composition is crowded with about 500 highly-detailed figures. Upon the completion of Paradise, Tintoretto would slow down his production and didn't take any major commissions anymore. In 1594, Tintoretto was struck with severe stomach pains, aggravated by high fever, depriving him of sleeping and eating. Jacopo Tintoretto died on 31 May 1594 and was buried next to his daughter Marietta, who died four years prior. They rest at the church of the Madonna dell' Orto. ",

      "description": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti was an English poet and artist. He was one of the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti was born in the city of London, in May 1828. His friends and family called him Gabriel, but he would sign Dante first, in Dante Alighieri's honor. Both his parents were notable scholars, his father, Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti, was also a secret society Carbonari’s founder. His mother was Frances Mary Lavinia Polidori. Rossetti was homeschooled for most of his childhood. Like his siblings, he showed an early interest in becoming a poet and attended the King’s College School. He demonstrated the will to become a poet like all his siblings, as well as a painter, and nurtured a keen interest in Medieval Italian art. Between 1841 and 1845, Rossetti at Henri Sass’ Drawing Academy, which he left to attend three years at the Royal Academy's Antique School. Upon leaving the Academy, Rossetti began to study under British painter Ford Madox Brown, who became a close friend throughout his life. Following the exhibition of the painting The Eve of St. Agnes by William Holman Hunt, inspired by a poem by John Keats. Rossetti immediately tried to make acquaintances with Hunt, for said artwork caused a deep impression on the artist. Soon, Rossetti created a poem and painting. Both were called The Blessed Damozel, and both became Rossetti’s most famous artworks in their respective fields. The poem was an imitation of John Keats, showing that both artists shared the same inspirations. Together, Rossetti and Hunt developed the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which was established along with John Everett Millais. The group’s central philosophy was to reject the impending artist style, represented by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Michelangelo and Raphael, hence the name. The Brotherhood thought that said style was a mechanical and superficial approach to art, same to the regime Sir Joshua Reynolds introduced at the Royal Academy of Arts. Following a harsh reception of his painting Ecce Ancilla Domini, exhibited in 1850, Rossetti would turn to watercolor painting, which he sold privately. Rossetti would return to oil painting around 1860. He developed his style to striking close-up compositions of women, immersed in pictorial spaces characterized by his strong use of color. Said paintings became a pivotal influence on the Symbolist movement. In 1862, Rossetti’s died of a laudanum overdose, possibly a suicide, since he recently gave birth to a stillborn child. The loss of his beloved plunged the artist into depression. The harsh critic reaction to his poetry contributed to Rossetti’s mental breakdown in 1872. Towards the end of his life, Rossetti descended into a morbid state, worsened by an addiction to chloral hydrate. Dante Gabriel Rossetti died on April 9, 1882, Easter Sunday. ",

      "description": "Annibale Carracci was an Italian painter active Late Renaissance period. Annibale, his brother Agostino, and cousin Ludovico were the main progenitors of the Baroque style, paving the way for a revolution on art as a whole. Annibale Carracci was born on November 3, 1560, in the city of Bologna, Italy. Annibale would learn printmaking from his brother Agostino Carracci, and painting, from his cousin Ludovico Carracci. Annibale’s early genre and portrait paintings suggest that the artist could have also trained under Bartolomeo Passarotti. Annibale’s earliest dated artworks, Crucifixion and the Baptism of Christ indicate that, during his initial development, the artist studied both northern and central Italian artists. During the late 1570s and 1580s, the artist probably set on a study trip to observe artworks by admired artists, such a trip was known at the time as studioso corso. Scholars suggest that at some point in 1580, Carracci was in Parma copying Correggio’s frescoes in the Duomo’s cupola. The influence of said period in Parma shows in his murals executed in 1584, Jason and The Aeneid, located at the Palazzo Fava in Bologna, made in collaboration with Ludovico and Agostino. In 1582, was founded the Accademia degli Incamminati, an academy created by the Carracci family, Annibale, Ludovico, and Agostino. They aimed to teach bold and innovative artistic theories, rebelling against the Mannerism of their contemporaries, seeing their practice as an artificial, mechanistic process. Their teaching program included the study of preceding artists and the study of nature, believing that this program would renew art as a whole. At some point during this time, due to the explorations of said concepts, the Carracci would achieve a common art style. In 1592, they executed the frescoes in the Palazzo Magnani in Rome, The She-Wolf Suckling Romulus and Remus, depicting the story of the founding of Rome. Upon its completion, when asked which member family member created such a masterpiece, they responded that it was all of them, The Carracci. Said event explains why their early artworks are often indistinguishable. Between 1959 and 1597, Annibale was commissioned to execute frescoes on the ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese’s Camerino, before being appointed to paint the Palazzo’s Gallery, which was completed with Agostino’s aid. Their masterpiece at the Gallery would become one of the most influential ceiling frescoes of the 17th-century and a required stop to any artist, art lover, and sophisticated seller visiting Rome for the next couple of centuries. By 1605, Annibale’s health began to decline, much possible due to his harsh treatment under the patronage of Cardinal Farnese. He was still able to execute the designs for the Herrara Chapel, which were completed by his pupils. Annibale Carracci died on July 15, 1609. ",

      "description": "Armand Guillaumin was a French Impressionist painter, known primarily for his landscapes around Paris, Esterel, and Creuse. Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin was born in February 1841, in Paris. He was sent to school in Moulins, which was essential to his future, for it was when he began to devolve an interest in art. The main reason was because of the region’s mountainous landscape. It was also when he began his lifelong friendship with Eugene Murer, who would later become a distinguished Impressionist collector. By 16 years old, Guillaumin was already back in Paris, working as a clerk at his uncle’s shop, while studying art under the sculptor Caillouet. Such studies would create friction between him and his family, causing him to look for another job, although still studying art, now at the Academie Suisse in 1861, where he came in contact with Courbet and made more lasting friendships with Oller, Pissarro, and Cezanne. Even at the beginning of his career, Guillaumin was already regarded as an accomplished draughtsman, using economic and dynamic movements to create his compositions. Guillaume exhibited at the first Salon des Refuses in 1863, participating in six of the eight exhibitions. By the year 1880, The Impressionist group was beginning to fragment, with groups forming around Pissarro and Degas, which artists were drawn to either side. Gaugin, who was becoming a rather prominent voice in the artistic community, sided heavily towards Pissarro and made great efforts to include Guillaumin by his side. Manet and Renoir would join the Impressionist Exhibition of 1882, along with Guillaumin, Pissarro, Gauguin, among others; Degas’ absence was duly noted at the time. By 1885 Guillaumin, although being highly revered as an artist, began to outgrow the Impressionist movement he participated in since its birth. The group crumbled mainly because of Gauguin’s difficult temper and intolerance, which destroyed it from inside. In 1886, Guillaumin would marry and settle in Paris. By the end of the decade, Guillaumin would become a mentor and close friend of Vincent van Gogh, who would also be a keen stimulus and influence to Guillaumin’s subsequent artworks. At the beginning of the 1890s, Guillaumin began experimenting with more striking colors, anticipating the Fauvism. Armand Guillaumin died in 1927, in Orly, France. He lived quite a long life and was the last surviving Impressionist artist. ",

      "description": "Caspar David Friedrich is known as one of the most influential and unique German artists of Romanticism. He was born on September 1774, had nine other siblings, and a soap boiler and candle-maker father called Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich. Some sources state the Friedrich family struggled with poverty. Being that true or not, the young soon-to-be artist and his father endured many tragic loses in their family. At seven years old, he lost his mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, and one of his sisters passed away only a year later. In 1787, Friedrich saw his brother drown after falling in a frozen pond, possibly the worst tragedy of his life. Just four years later, another sister died after becoming terribly ill. Art historians link the disasters Friedrich went through to the feeling of grief, sorrow, and loneliness present in his artwork throughout his life. In 1790, he officially began studying art at the University of Greifswald, his hometown. Friedrich was encouraged to draw from life, and outdoors, he also met Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten through his teacher, which influenced him to ponder about the spirituality in his art. His teachers also showed works of other landscape artists, like Adam Elsheimer, who mixed religious subjects with landscape paintings. Although art was his major, Friedrich also studied aesthetics under Thomas Thorild, a Swedish professor. The artist continued to invest in his education and left for the Academy of Copenhagen four years later. Although Friedrich’s reputation as an artist was established as an oil painter, he experimented with many other media, like printmaking, mostly metal etching, and woodcuts. He also worked with watercolor, ink, and sepia painting, especially during the period in which he was settled in Dresden, by the end of the 1700s. Even when experimenting with different material, the artist’s primary theme became the same, as he would prefer to portray the beautiful landscapes he encountered. Friedrich became more and more discontent with the consumerism and value that people gave to the material aspects of life. Like other the landscape artists which he admired, like J. M. W. Turner and John Constable, he was lead to a spiritual state of mind in which the concept of nature is a divine creation. It was only in 1805, at the age of 31, that Friedrich began to receive the recognition he deserved, because of the praise he got after winning the Weimar competition with two sepia paintings. The Romanticist became a member of the prestigious Berlin Academy in 1810 and married Caroline Bommer eight years later. The couple had three children together. Even though his contribution to German art was significant, he died in obscurity in the year 1840 in Dresden, Germany. It was only by the 1920s that his art was rediscovered by the modern painters of the Expressionist movement, who deeply appreciated his work, along with the Surrealists in the 1930s. Unfortunately for Friedrich, his paintings began to be associated with the Nazi movement because of its sense of nationalism, but he was able to regain his reputation as one of the greatest German painters by the late 1970s.
